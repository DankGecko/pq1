//! PQSigner firmware release-signing tool.
//!
//! **Production quarantine:** the current subcommands emit and verify legacy
//! manifest v0x02 / `PQFW_V1` artifacts. They remain useful for bench tests,
//! but are not Draft 1.1's proposed V6 interface and must not produce a
//! shipping release. The root `make release` gate fails until the candidate is
//! approved and its V6/backend/resource/release gates are implemented.
//!
//! This is the host-side companion to the on-device FSBL. It produces
//! signed `.pqfw` release bundles that the companion updater app streams
//! to the wallet over USB HID. The tool lives outside the firmware
//! because the vendor root signing key must never touch the device — it
//! lives in an offline, ideally air-gapped, signing machine.
//!
//! ## Subcommands
//!
//! * `keygen`  — generate a new vendor signing key (offline, one-time).
//! * `pubkey`  — export the vendor public key for FSBL embedding.
//! * `sign`    — sign a pair of secure + nonsecure ELFs into a `.pqfw`.
//! * `verify`  — independently verify a `.pqfw` against a pubkey.
//! * `inspect` — dump manifest fields from a `.pqfw` (for debugging).
//!
//! The same checks FSBL runs at boot are reachable through `verify`, so
//! CI can use `fwsign verify` as a proxy for "will FSBL accept this?".
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! Every subcommand is fully deterministic given its inputs. `sign` in
//! particular does not hedge the SPHINCS+C10 signature — it calls
//! `sign(hash, None)` so the signature over a given (secure, nonsecure,
//! version, vendor_key, slot) tuple is byte-identical on every run.
//! This lets CI re-sign a release and confirm the bundle bytes match
//! a prior signing run bit-for-bit.
