# PQSigner OS — Threat Model

**Status:** living document. Updated 2026-05-12; 2026-07-07 (ML-KEM inner wrap descoped — §9.1 residual ACCEPTED by owner; Claim 7 + T7 table reworded accordingly).
**Scope:** the full firmware + hardware product. STM32U585 (Cortex-M33, TrustZone) host MCU, Infineon OPTIGA Trust M V3 + NXP EdgeLock SE050 secure elements, on-chain ERC-4337 v0.6 smart wallet (`PQSmartWallet`).
**Companion documents:** `docs/security/HARDENING.md` (hardening requirements — *what* we do), `docs/security/production-security.md` (research synthesis — *which mitigations* we landed and why), `CLAUDE.md` invariants (the non-negotiable contracts), this doc (*who* attacks *what*, with *what capability*, and how each attack is stopped or accepted).

This document is **falsifiable by design.** Every claim of the form "attacker X cannot do Y" can be tested by an attacker performing X and observing Y. The pre-production sections list known regressions plainly — anything labelled "PROD-INVARIANT" must hold on a shipping unit; anything labelled "PRE-PROD-CAVEAT" is a knowingly-live regression that production CI gates against.

## 1. Methodology

We use STRIDE-shaped surface enumeration but the framing is deliberately attacker-capability-driven rather than threat-type-driven. The reason: a wallet's job is to refuse a specific list of attackers along a specific list of dimensions, not to chase a generic spoofing/tampering taxonomy that doesn't carve at the joints of an embedded PQ stack.

For each attack we record:

- **Surface** — the data path or component the attacker reaches.
- **Adversary tier** required (T0…T7, defined in §4).
- **Mitigation** — the in-tree mechanism(s) that defeat it, with code-path references.
- **Empirical verification** — the test or measurement that backs the claim.
- **Residual risk** — what's still possible if every mitigation lands.

Attacks the design *does not* defend against are written down in §10 with the same rigour as the ones it does. A threat model that omits its scope boundary is propaganda.

## 2. Assets and Sensitivity Classes

| Class | Asset | Where it lives | Loss impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S0 — fund-equivalent** | `bip39_seed` (64 B), reconstructed `entropy` (32 B), `masterSk` C10 (96 B working, ~ 4 KB derivation state), `slotSk` C10, `master_secret` and `slot_master` derivation pivots | OPTIGA + SE050 (XOR split at rest); S-SRAM transiently during signing | Total: attacker can spend every wallet ever derived from this seed across every chain |
| **S1 — single-account-equivalent** | A single `(account_index, chain_id, slot_index)` slotSk in S-SRAM during a single signing window | S-SRAM only, ≤ 120 s after each sign | One chain's funds on one account until on-chain cap (≤ 65 536 spends) is reached |
| **S2 — channel-equivalent** | OPTIGA Platform Binding Secret (PBS), SE050 SCP03 ENC/MAC/DEK, SE050 admin UserID | The factory-burned per-device OTP master derives the transport SCP03/admin/PBS credentials. The implemented first-field candidate creates the BHK after RDP2, rotates SE050 to unsalted BHK-rooted final credentials, and rotates OPTIGA to a final PBS derived from DHUK plus a page-127-persisted TRNG salt. Handoff/recovery, exact E140 order, silicon evidence, and production approval remain OPEN. No plaintext channel key is intended to persist. | Bus-snoop / channel-impersonation against this device only. Does **not** alone unlock funds — see §6 |
| **S3 — auth-equivalent** | User PIN (raw), PIN-derived auth ref values stored in OPTIGA F1D0 + SE050 UserID | SE silicon (never MCU, never NS) | Online brute-force: 10 attempts → factory wipe (see §7.4) |
| **S4 — identity-equivalent** | Per-die DHUK (factory-fused), factory transport OTP master, BHK target, candidate rollback-floor OTP records, candidate vendor-key identity | STM32 silicon / protected state. DHUK is SAES-only; the BHK lifecycle exists in code but its production first-write flow is not approved. The factory-burned OTP master is transport-only; field auto-burn or reuse as a final root is rejected. The unary rollback tally is production-rejected, while Draft 1.1's physical OTP allocation and vendor-key binding remain OPEN. | Decap-class only for established silicon roots; candidate OTP/vendor records carry no production authority until their backend and ceremony close. The on-device PIN gate (§7.4) remains independently required. |
| **S5 — integrity-equivalent** | Firmware secure/nonsecure images, FSBL, on-chain bytecode at the deployed proxy + factory + implementation + verifier addresses, vendor C10 signing key (off-device, HSM) | Flash (current FSBL geometry is legacy bench-only; Draft 1.1 protection/layout is unapproved), on-chain CREATE2-derived addresses, vendor HSM | Persistent backdoor or substituted code path; downstream affects S0–S3 |
| **S6 — availability** | PIN-attempt controls, on-chain per-chain caps, page-123 offchain counter | MCU page 124, OPTIGA E120 LUC, SE050 UserID, on-chain storage | Brick (DoS) — funds frozen but not extracted. Note: bricking is a *defence outcome*, not an attack outcome we care about preventing |
| **S7 — privacy** | Wallet on-chain identity ↔ user, list of signed transactions, BIP-39 measurement words | On-chain (public), local NV3007 LCD (transient), companion app (depends on app) | Surveillance / deanonymisation; not financial loss |

The shipping invariant is: **no attack that does not break at least one S4 asset AND the S3 asset (user PIN) AND the S5 firmware integrity reaches an S0 asset.** The dual-SE split, three-way per-attempt PIN consumption, and FI-hardened verify-before-release together encode that invariant in silicon-anchored code. Boot reconciliation is narrower: a directional page124/E120 check with no SE050 attempt-count input.

## 3. Trust Boundaries

A boundary is *non-trivial* when its two sides are governed by different keys, different code, different vendors, or different physical chips. Boundaries are the only places where exploitable mismatches live.

| Boundary | Crossing format | Direction(s) of trust | Code path |
|---|---|---|---|
| **B-USB** Companion ↔ device | USB HID, APDU v2 (`nonsecure/src/usb/{commands,hid,transport}.rs`) | Device trusts companion *only* for non-secret metadata (chain_id, slot_index, flags, displayed tx fields); never for secret material | NS-side parser → NSC veneer |
| **B-NSC** NS ↔ S (TrustZone-M) | CMSE `cmse-nonsecure-entry` veneers on STM32U585; shared-memory mailbox on QEMU | S **never** trusts NS pointers, lengths, or contents without validation + copy-in | `secure/src/nsc/{ptr_validate,ns_ptr}.rs`; every `cmd_*::run` copies NS buffers to S-stack before parse |
| **B-UI** S ↔ user (NV3007 LCD + 2 buttons) | Trusted-path dialogs (`secure/src/ui/{confirm,pin_entry,seed_wizard}.rs`); buttons + LCD are S-owned peripherals via GTZC | User trusts what they see; S trusts only what they physically pressed | NS opinion of a button press is ignored — the S-only TIM2 inactivity timer is not reset by NS pings (§7.6) |
| **B-OPT** S ↔ OPTIGA Trust M V3 | OPTIGA Shielded Connection (TLS-PRF + AES-128-CCM-8). The factory prepares the chip on an OTP-master-derived transport PBS; the first-field candidate rotates to a final PBS derived from per-die DHUK plus a page-127-persisted TRNG salt after RDP2. The exact E140 lifecycle-versus-rotation order remains OPEN and silicon-gated. | S trusts OPTIGA only for the `half_O` bits it returns under successful E120/F1D0 silicon-gated read | `secure/src/optiga/{shield,apdu,ifx_i2c}.rs` |
| **B-SE0** S ↔ SE050 | SCP03 (AES-CMAC + AES-CBC). The factory installs OTP-master-derived transport keys/admin credential; the first-field candidate creates the BHK and rotates to unsalted BHK-rooted final SCP03/admin material. The user UserID is PIN-derived. | S trusts SE050 only for `half_E` bits returned under successful user-UserID read | `secure/src/se050/{scp03,apdu,t1oi2c}.rs` |
| **B-OTP** S firmware ↔ STM32 OTP | The factory burns the per-device transport master before shipment; field auto-burn and final-root reuse are forbidden. Candidate one-way rollback-floor records and vendor-key binding remain separate. The unary tally is production-fenced; Draft 1.1's physical codec, allocation, interruption handling, and factory procedure remain OPEN. | Field firmware may consume only the already-provisioned transport master; no other immutable authority exists before the reviewed backend, exact map, and owner-authorized ceremony close | `secure/src/hw/otp.rs`; `docs/security/a-b-firmware-rollback-architecture.md` |
| **B-FW** Vendor HSM ↔ device | Candidate: SPHINCS+C10 signature over Draft 1.1's proposed 121-byte, slot-bound `PQFW_V6` preimage; vendor public key compiled into FSBL | Draft 1.1 is not implementation-approved; production is compile-blocked until exact-digest approval plus manifest-v6, journal/ECC/OTP, FLASH, RAM/stack, release-policy, factory, and silicon gates close | `docs/security/a-b-firmware-rollback-architecture.md`, `fsbl/`, `fwsign/`, `fw-manifest/` |
| **B-CHAIN** Device ↔ on-chain wallet contract | C10 signature wrapped in `SignatureWrapper(uint256 ownerIndex, bytes c10Sig)`; per-chain `slot_entropy = sha256(slot_master‖"slot_entropy"‖chain_id_be8‖slot_index_be4)` so the slot keypair is chain-bound | Contract verifies the C10 sig stateless against the wrapper's `ownerIndex` lookup; trust crosses only via the wallet's own storage | `contracts/smart-wallet/src/{PQSmartWallet,PQSmartWalletFactory,verifiers/SPHINCsC10Asm}.sol` |
| **B-FAB** Factory ↔ device (provisioning) | Future reviewed ceremony; current legacy receipt is quarantined | No factory trust anchor or RDP2 authority exists until the replacement receipt/ordering and silicon evidence are approved | `docs/provisioning/factory-provisioning.md`, Draft 1.1 §13 candidate |
| **B-TZ-S** S code ↔ S code (privilege tiers) | **PLANNED** — Trezor-style MPU banking + secure-privileged/secure-non-privileged SAES key tiers. Currently absent: a bug in any S-world code can call `secret_keys::derive_into{,_bhk}` directly | Within S, one privilege level today | `docs/architecture/trezor-comparison.md §3.2` — tracked, not yet landed |

Every boundary either has a cryptographic authenticator on each side, a hardware-enforced permission, or both. Boundaries with neither (e.g. B-UI button press) are sized to be self-evident to the user (you physically pressed a button — there is no impersonation surface inside the S-only TIM-driven timer).

## 4. Adversary Tiers

Capabilities stack: a Tn attacker has every capability of T₀ … T_{n−1}. We do **not** define "T-everything" — different attacks need different tiers, and the design's security claim is exactly which tier each S-class asset survives.

### T0 — Remote / software only
No physical access. Can run any code on the companion host, MITM the USB link, supply arbitrary APDUs, supply arbitrary on-chain data, MITM the bundler / paymaster, supply malicious chain RPC responses, run unlimited offline computation on harvested signatures and on harvested traffic.

Models: rogue companion app, supply-chain-compromised npm package on the dapp side, hostile mempool observer, a quantum-equipped harvester collecting USB traffic and on-chain calldata for later analysis.

### T1 — Casual physical (powered-off device)
T0 + has the device in hand for hours, powered off; can connect USB, plug into a strange charger, push buttons. No bench equipment, no soldering, no opening.

Models: stolen wallet from a coat pocket; a customs officer with cable but no toolchain; a roommate with a laptop.

### T2 — Bench attacker (powered-on, no FI)
T1 + can power the board, scope I²C/USB lines, attach a logic analyzer, JTAG/SWD probe (defeated by RDP-2 in prod), pop the case, drop in alternate firmware to NS pins, swap a passive component, remove and replace a chip with a hot-air station.

Models: chip-swap supply-chain attack mid-transit; an evil-maid who can revisit the device repeatedly while powered; a forensic-lab opponent below the cost of fault injection.

### T3 — Fault injection (FI) / side-channel analysis (SCA)
T2 + voltage glitch, EMFI rig (ChipShouter / SiliconToaster), laser FI on a decapped die, Rowhammer-on-bus equivalents; horizontal/vertical DPA on the power rail; EM SCA against the package; TVLA / template SCA on harvested traces.

Models: Ledger Donjon March 2025 Trezor Safe 3 voltage-glitch; Masaryk U Simonik thesis 76% PIN-glitch on STM32U5A9; Saarinen "SLotH" CRYPTO 2024 on SLH-DSA PRF.

### T4 — Invasive silicon (decap + microprobe)
T3 + chemical/laser decap, FIB, SEM, microprobing. Tens to hundreds of thousand-dollar budget, destroys the unit, single shot per device.

Models: state-actor lab attempting OTP master extraction or DHUK readout.

### T5 — Coercion (rubber-hose / shoulder-surf)
Attacker physically present, can compel user to enter PIN, observe entry, threaten until cooperation.

Models: $5-wrench, drug interrogation, shoulder-surf in coffee shop.

### T6 — Supply chain
Capability between factory and unboxing: substitute firmware, substitute chips, intercept first-boot, ship a clone with valid-looking attestation, compromise the factory HSM or provisioning station.

Models: customs intercept; compromised contract manufacturer; rogue insider with provisioning-station access; vendor HSM extraction.

### T7 — Cryptographically-relevant quantum computer (CRQC)
Can run Shor on captured classical public keys / signatures (no impact here — there are no classical signatures in the trust path) and Grover against symmetric primitives with 2× root speedup.

Models: a near-term CRQC harvested everything from the day-one launch; a far-future CRQC against decade-old captured traffic.

## 5. Security Claims (the falsifiable contract)

Each claim is the conjunction of all attacks an attacker must execute to violate it. These are the load-bearing statements of the whole product.

**Claim 1 — Single-chip break is harmless.**
> An attacker who fully owns *one* of {OPTIGA, SE050} but not the other and not the MCU recovers **zero** bits of `bip39_seed`.

Mechanism: XOR entropy split. `half_O` and `half_E` are independent random; `entropy = HKDF(half_O XOR half_E)`. A break on either chip yields one uniformly-random 32-byte string. Falsifiable by extracting one chip's plaintext and confirming statistical independence from the seed.

**Claim 2 — DHUK / BHK leak is not fund-extracting.**
> An attacker with a Tier-1 DHUK extraction (or future BHK extraction) gains the SE050 admin UserID and the OPTIGA PBS for *this device only*. They can **brick** the device by issuing admin `DELETE` against `half_E`. They **cannot READ** `half_E` — the user-PIN gate is enforced in SE silicon, not by the encrypted channel.

Mechanism: SE050 PIN policy template (`apdu::build_policy`, `se050/apdu.rs:339-365`) splits ACs across two entries — user has `READ|WRITE|DELETE|REQUIRE_SM`, admin has only `DELETE|REQUIRE_SM`. Falsifiable by `make se050-admin-extract-attempt-e2e` — already validated 2026-05-11 on B-U585I-IOT02A board #1, ST-LINK SN `0029…3838` (see `docs/security/production-security.md §2.6 "Empirically validated"`). On OPTIGA, `half_O` sits under `Auto(F1D0)` AuthRef with E140 (PBS) authenticating only the channel — the read AC is a different mechanism with the same property; an analogous E2E for OPTIGA is on the list.

**Claim 3 — PIN brute force costs at most 10 wrong attempts before factory wipe.**
> Each ordinary attempt precharges MCU page 124 and exercises OPTIGA E120 plus
> SE050 UserID. Page 124 and SE050 independently enforce the user-facing
> max-10 bound; E120 is a separate silicon-monotonic backstop. At boot,
> firmware reads page 124 and E120 and wipes only if E120 is ahead. The SE050
> remaining-attempt attribute is policy-denied (`0x6986`) and is not a boot
> reconciliation input. Offline brute force against persisted PIN material is
> structurally impossible because the PIN never leaves SE silicon.

Mechanism: three-way per-attempt enforcement, `nsc::gated_unlock` pre-commit,
and `factory_reset_admin` on strike #10, with the directional MCU/E120 boot
check described above. `make pin-gate-hw-counter-e2e` falsifies only the
per-attempt, in-run desynchronization-recovery, and simulated cache-resync
portion; `make pin-gate-wipe-e2e` falsifies the ten-wrong lockout/wipe portion.
The directional boot predicate needs a separate cold-reboot silicon receipt
and remains OPEN.

**⚠️ PROVISIONAL — currently violated by ship blocker S-1 (`EthereumPhone/PQ1`, label `ship-blocker`).** **S-5 + S-6 RESOLVED 2026-05-28**, see closure notes below. Against a *desoldered-OPTIGA bench-rig* attacker (i.e. the threat that motivates the LUC at all), the OPTIGA leg of this claim does not hold in the current build: `F1D0.Change = ALW` (`secure/src/optiga/apdu.rs:930`, `:1059`) lets an attacker overwrite F1D0 with a chosen key, self-auth, and reset E120 indefinitely. On-board ordinary attempts still consume all three controls; firmware-side `gated_unlock` precharges MCU page 124 and SE050 independently enforces max-10, while E120 is a 32-use backstop. This is per-attempt composition, not symmetric three-counter boot reconciliation. Until S-1 is closed (F1D0 metadata tightened to `Auto(F1D0)` + LcsO ratchet), read this claim as "10 wrong PINs against MCU + SE050; OPTIGA contributes belt-and-braces *on-board* only." Re-establishing the OPTIGA desoldered-chip claim requires closing S-1 and re-running `pin-gate-hw-counter-e2e` against a ratcheted, owner-authorized sacrificial part with the tightened metadata.

**S-5 closure (2026-05-28):** `secure/src/se050/scp03.rs` now negotiates `P1=0x33` (full C-MAC + C-DEC + R-MAC + R-ENC); `scp03::unwrap_response` decrypts + R-MAC-verifies every response. `half_E` is no longer plaintext on the I²C bus during legitimate unlocks. Logic-analyzer silicon-verification still required to fully close the audit step. See `docs/security/security-review-2026-05.md` §C-7.

**S-6 closure (2026-05-28):** `store_objects` and `store_duress_objects` pass `None` for the user / duress UserID's admin-delete policy entry; admin can no longer delete + recreate USERID_OBJ to substitute the PIN. Data objects retain the admin entry so DoS-wipe still works. Trade-off: post-lockout, the chip is single-use (USERID_OBJ stays orphaned; OID range bump required to re-provision). NXP's bare `DeleteAll` APDU is gated on `RESERVED_ID_FACTORY_RESET = 0x7FFF0205` chip credential we don't hold — full-chip factory reset from firmware is out of scope. See `docs/security/security-review-2026-05.md` §C-8 + the updated Claim 5 below.

**Claim 5 (revised 2026-05-28) — Post-lockout secret state on SE050: *data destroyed, UserID orphaned*.** When the SE050 UserID hits `auth_attempts == max_attempts`, the UserID locks (policy denies further VERIFY). `admin_factory_reset` then opens an admin session against `ADMIN_WIPE_OBJ` and deletes every data object (ENTROPY_OBJ, VK_OBJ, BOOTSTRAP_VK_OBJ — they still carry the admin-delete policy entry per the post-S-6 design); the chip enforces those deletes because the policy explicitly authorises admin. **The data is destroyed in this path.** USERID_OBJ itself remains on chip in its locked state because the post-S-6 policy gives admin NO delete authority on it (S-6's whole point — closes the substitution attack). So the chip is single-use after lockout: the seed half is gone (Claim 7 + the safety contract), but USERID_OBJ at `0x7B10_0000` is now an immutable, locked auth object gating nothing. Re-provisioning the same chip requires bumping the firmware OID range (v6 → v7) so a fresh UserID can live at a different OID; bumping the range is a one-line firmware change but does not recover the original chip's v6 OIDs. **The previous Claim 5 wording ("orphaned, not erased") referred to the pre-S-6 / pre-S-7b state where `iterative_delete_all` Pass 2 silently failed and data survived — that path is closed:** Pass 2 still requires PIN-verified session for UserID self-delete (which lockout precludes), but data wipe via `admin_factory_reset` is the explicit destroy path now, not Pass 2's UserID self-delete. NXP's bare `DeleteAll` APDU (`80 04 00 2A`, AN12413 §4.19.5) would wipe USERID_OBJ too but requires `RESERVED_ID_FACTORY_RESET` chip credential not exposed to our firmware; documented as out-of-scope.

**Claim 4 — Forged C10 signature requires breaking SPHINCS+ or stealing the seed.**
> No signing path admits a signature whose owner-key was not derived from a successful unlock against this device's silicon-anchored entropy halves. EIP-1271 path forbids `ownerIndex == 0`; Type 1 path bumps `bootstrapUses` regardless of revert; Type 2 path bumps `slotUses[i]`.

Mechanism: `validateUserOp` ABI-decodes `SignatureWrapper(uint256 ownerIndex, bytes signatureData)` and dispatches stateless to `c10Verifier` (`SPHINCsC10Asm.sol`). The verifier is single — no fallback verifier path, no toggle. Verify-before-release on the device side double-checks the just-produced signature under FI-hardened sentinels (`crypto::c10_sign_verified*`).

**Claim 5 — Cross-chain replay is structurally impossible.**
> A C10 signature produced for `(account_index_A, chain_id_A, slot_index_A)` does not verify against `(account_index_A, chain_id_B, slot_index_A)`.

Mechanism: slot keys are chain-bound — `slot_entropy = sha256(slot_master‖"slot_entropy"‖chain_id_be8‖slot_index_be4)`. Different `chain_id` ⇒ different sk ⇒ different pkRoot ⇒ on-chain `ownerAtIndex[slot_index]` differs ⇒ verify fails. CREATE2 still pins to the same address on every chain because the address depends only on `(masterPkSeed, masterPkRoot)` and the bootstrap key is chain-agnostic.

**Claim 6 — On-chain cap is monotonic and unresettable.**
> `bootstrapUses < 65_536` and `slotUses[i] + offchainSigCount[i] < 65_536` are invariants of contract storage with no `reset*` / `increase*` path. Exhausted chains stay frozen.

Mechanism: `PQMultiOwnable` (ERC-7201 storage) + no admin path in `PQSmartWallet`. Falsifiable by attempting to author a UserOp post-cap and observing it revert.

**Claim 7 — Quantum harvester cannot recover the seed.**
> A CRQC adversary who recorded every byte of USB traffic, every byte of I²C traffic, every byte of on-chain calldata and every block since launch recovers **zero** seed bits.

Mechanism: no primitive in the trust path gives a quantum adversary better than Grover.
- Signing: SPHINCS+C10 (hash-based, no number-theoretic assumption, no quantum speedup beyond Grover-on-hash).
- SE channels: symmetric-rooted key agreement only (OPTIGA PBS = per-device DHUK-derived pre-shared secret → TLS-PRF; SE050 SCP03 = per-device static AES keys → CMAC KDF). **No public-key handshake crosses the bus**, so recorded traffic contains nothing Shor-breakable; the only attack on a capture is Grover key search on the AES-128 session key.
- Symmetric: AES-256, SHA-256/512, HMAC-SHA256, HKDF-SHA256, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 — all with key sizes sized so Grover leaves ≥ 128-bit effective security.
- Address derivation, EVM hashing: SHA-256 and Keccak-256 — both quantum-resistant under Grover-only.

**Accepted residual (owner decision 2026-07-07, was PRE-PROD-CAVEAT §9.1):** the entropy halves cross I²C under AES-128 session encryption (Shielded Connection CCM-8 / SCP03), so an adversary who physically tapped the bus during a live unlock holds ciphertext attackable at ~2⁶⁴ serial Grover operations per session — NIST Category 1, the same floor as C10's n=16 signatures — and must break both tunnels independently (XOR split, Claim 1). Two conditions keep this acceptance sound: (a) per-device SCP03/PBS rotation (§9.2 ceremony) — session keys derive deterministically from the statics with **no forward secrecy**, so fleet-shared statics would degrade a tapped session to a classical decrypt (the ProVerif `scp03_handshake.pv` static-leak residual); (b) the payload exposure stays unlock-time-only (no half ever crosses outside an authenticated session). The formerly-planned ML-KEM-1024 inner wrap that would have lifted this above the Cat-1 floor is descoped; the prototype is retained feature-gated (`docs/security/ml-kem-inner-wrap.md`).

**Claim 8 — Firmware-update path admits only payloads signed by the pinned vendor key.**
> **Candidate claim, not a current shipping or implementation claim:** a manifest-v6 update is
> admitted only when its C10 signature verifies under the FSBL-pinned vendor
> key and the typed selector/floor state admits its `(release, epoch)` tuple.

Candidate mechanism: immutable FSBL + Draft-1.1 manifest-v6 verification and typed marker/selector/floor interfaces. The runtime may seal a candidate CONFIRMED only after the candidate health flow; only the FSBL may establish `security_epoch - 1`. The eventual approved FSBL range must be protected in both physical banks; the current legacy bench range does not settle candidate geometry or factory authority. Draft 1.1 remains an unapproved research candidate.

> **SHIP BLOCKER (2026-07-14, verified against RM0456 and source).** The implemented V1 path is not a sound production anti-rollback backend. `cmd_fw_commit.rs` raises the floor before candidate health, defeating try-once recovery, and `hw/otp.rs` attempts to reprogram ECC-protected STM32U585 OTP quad-words as a bit tally. There is no OPTIGA firmware-version counter. Draft 1.1 proposes replacement software interfaces but is not implementation-approved; journal hardware/durability, FLASH mutation closure, ECC, OTP codec/capacity, RAM/stack, release policy, factory authority, and silicon evidence remain open. Production, FSBL-release, factory receipts, and RDP2 authority are compile/process blocked meanwhile.

**Claim 9 — Trusted UI faithfully renders signed semantics.**
> Whatever the NV3007 LCD shows in a confirm screen is exactly what the signed `userOpHash` preimage commits to; the user pressing both buttons binds their consent to the displayed bytes.

Mechanism: the confirmation page renderer (`secure/src/tx/display/*`) runs in S-world, reads from the S-stack copy of the parsed UserOp, displays from the S-owned NV3007 LCD via S-driven SPI. The page-renderer code is what hashes into `userOpHash` (i.e. there is no second path that displays one thing and signs another). For ERC-20 the recipient symbol/decimals come from a Merkle-verified bundle (`secure/src/erc20/` checks against the firmware-baked `ERC20_DB_ROOT`); unknown contracts fall through to "⚠ BLIND SIGNING". For structured clear-signed paths (Safe SafeTx / multiSend, CoW `GPv2Order`, ERC-7730 descriptors, typed-call ABI) the payload is decoded **natively on-device** in S-world and the decode is cross-checked against the signed bytes (e.g. `cowswap/verify.rs` binds the rendered order to the settlement calldata; the Safe EIP-712 hash is recomputed locally). Falsifiable by constructing a malicious bundle/calldata and observing rejection.

## 6. Cross-cutting Defence Architecture

Three patterns appear across every attack. They are the spine of the design.

### 6.1 Dual-residency rule (the XOR split)
*Every fund-equivalent secret must require both of {OPTIGA, SE050} to recover. Neither chip alone reveals any bit.* This rule is enforced at provisioning (`dual_se::provision`) and at every unlock (`reconstruct_entropy = HKDF(half_O XOR half_E)`). It is what reduces the attack from "compromise one chip" (well-precedented in the literature — Ledger Donjon, Trezor Safe 3) to "compromise two chips from two vendors of two architectures simultaneously."

### 6.2 PIN gate in silicon (three-way per-attempt consumption)
*PIN compare always happens inside SE silicon, never in MCU code.* Each ordinary
attempt consumes page-124, OPTIGA E120/F1D0 authorization, and SE050 UserID.
Page-124 and SE050 enforce the max-10 policy; E120 is a 32-use silicon backstop.
`CMD_GET_REMAINING` reports a conservative user-facing runtime status, not a
three-silicon boot receipt. Boot reads page-124 and live E120 directionally and
wipes if E120 use leads page-124; an MCU lead is retained after cuts/errors.
SE050's attempt-count attribute is policy-denied and is not a boot input, while
blocked authentication still maps to wipe. This keeps PIN attacks online; it
does not claim symmetric three-way boot reconciliation.

### 6.3 Verify-before-release with double-compute (the FI guard)
*Every Type 1 / Type 2 signature is computed twice on disjoint SRAM regions, the two outputs are compared in constant time, and the signature is released only on byte-equal match plus a verify-after-sign hash check.* RFC 9814 §5 explicitly notes that verify-after-sign alone is insufficient for SLH-DSA against single-fault forgery (Genêt TCHES 2023). We do **both**: double-compute closes the Genêt grafting attack; verify-after-sign closes simpler glitches. Code: `crypto::c10_sign_verified*` + FI sentinels in `secure/src/fi.rs`.

These three patterns mean: every named attacker tier must beat *both* a silicon barrier and a code barrier to reach an S0 asset. There is no single-failure point in the system above the silicon-physical layer.

## 7. Attack Surfaces and Per-Surface Defences

### 7.1 Seed at rest

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Flash dump of MCU | T2 | The seed never persists on MCU flash. `entropy` is reconstructed in S-SRAM at unlock and zeroized on lock/timeout/tamper/brownout. | Nothing recoverable from MCU flash dump |
| Flash dump of OPTIGA (decap) | T4 | Yields only `half_O` — XOR-independent of `half_E` (Claim 1) | `half_O` alone is uniformly random |
| Flash dump of SE050 (decap) | T4 | Yields only `half_E` — same | `half_E` alone is uniformly random |
| Both chips decapped | T4 + T4 | XOR halves recoverable; user PIN gate still applies. SE050 user-UserID read AC blocks `half_E` even with admin auth (validated, Claim 2). OPTIGA F1D0 AuthRef gate blocks `half_O` similarly. So even decapping both chips, the attacker still needs to *use* the chip with its silicon-enforced PIN gate. | Realistic state-actor capability; cost dominated by getting past two different silicon PIN gates each capped at 10 attempts |

### 7.2 Seed in transit (SE channels)

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| I²C bus snoop (logic analyzer on traces) | T2 | OPTIGA Shielded Connection (TLS-PRF + AES-128-CCM-8, PBS-keyed); SE050 SCP03 (AES-CMAC + AES-CBC). The intended product ships OTP-master-derived transport credentials at RDP0; the first-field candidate rotates SE050 to BHK-rooted finals and OPTIGA to a salted-DHUK final PBS. | Symmetric-rooted AEAD; a capture is attackable only via Grover-2⁶⁴ on the session key — ACCEPTED residual (§7.14, §9.1; owner 2026-07-07). Per-device rotation is load-bearing (no forward secrecy in either KDF); the code exists but its handoff/recovery, silicon, and production gates remain open. |
| MITM with replayed handshake | T2 | SCP03 mutual auth + Shielded Connection's PBS-anchored TLS-PRF; freshness nonce on each session | None known once transport credentials are rotated per device (PRE-PROD-CAVEAT until the candidate is approved and silicon-validated — §9.2) |
| Bus desync / glitch the SE response | T3 | Channel MAC fails ⇒ APDU rejected; tamper response invokes lockout | Untested at production hardness |
| Channel key extraction from MCU OTP | T4 | DHUK only accessible via SAES (peripheral, not memory); BHK uplift (Stage 2) further hardens to "key must be *used* on this specific device" | A decap-class extraction of DHUK is the entry to the residual of Claim 2 — bricks possible, funds not extractable |

### 7.3 Seed in use (S-SRAM during signing)

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cold-boot attack on SRAM | T2 | Inactivity timeout (120 s) on S-only TIM; `zeroize::ZeroizeOnDrop` on every secret type with compiler fences (`zeroize` crate's IR-level fences, not `core::hint::black_box`); on lock the whole `master_secret` + `SLOT_CACHE` are wiped | The 120-s window is a UX concession. A T3 attacker hitting the window with a freezer trick is the residual; tightenable to e.g. 30 s |
| Read S-SRAM from NS world | T0 (firmware) | GTZC TZSC marks Secure SRAM secure; SAU regions enforce; MPU regions enforced in both worlds | **PRE-PROD-CAVEAT** §9.3: TZSC config currently regressed — see CLAUDE.md "Pre-Production Caveats" |
| DMA-master into Secure SRAM from NS | T0 | All DMA controllers blocked unless their instance is Secure (per HARDENING §4.1) | Pending TZSC restore per §9.3 |
| Bus-snoop the SAES output during signing | T3 | SAES outputs DHUK-keyed values inside the peripheral; never as a bus-visible byte | EM SCA of the SAES is research-relevant; consumption mask (TIM2 CH1 PWM, `hw/consumption_mask.rs`) randomises the power footprint |
| Side-channel on the SPHINCS+C10 PRF | T3 | OptRand mandatory: 16-byte fresh per-signature randomness from STM32 TRNG breaks chosen-message PRF recovery (Saarinen SLotH defence) | Software masking on the SHA-256 hot loop is a hardening-pass item; HASH peripheral has no DPA resistance per UM3370 |

### 7.4 PIN guessing

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Online brute force (USB-driven) | T0 / T1 | Three-way per-attempt consumption; page-124 + SE050 max-10 policy → factory wipe; E120 adds a 32-use backstop | At most 10 ordinary wrong attempts before destructive lockout; boot cross-check remains directional page124/E120 |
| Offline brute force against stored representation | — | No stored PIN representation exists outside SE silicon; the SE silicon compares constant-time + decrements its own counter | Structurally impossible |
| Power-glitch mid-verify to skip the counter bump | T3 | `gated_unlock` pre-commits the counter bump to MCU page 124 *before* the SE driver call; fail-in pattern (`if remaining != 0, continue; else wipe`); FI-hardened complement-storage on the success flag | Untested against state-actor FI; ITAMP9 (crypto-peripheral fault) wired (planned) catches SAES/PKA glitches |
| Shoulder-surf + force device unlock | T5 | Architecturally out of scope (§10.1) | Coercion defeats every PIN-gated system |
| Replay a captured authenticated channel | T2 | Each SCP03 / Shielded Connection session has fresh handshake; no replay window | None |

### 7.5 NSC gateway (NS → S boundary)

The 18 gateway commands (`CMD_GET_REMAINING`, `…SIGN_USEROP`, `…SIGN_OFFCHAIN`, `CMD_FW_*`, etc.) are the only legitimate way for NS code to influence S behaviour. Every command surface is treated as fully hostile NS input.

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| NS supplies a pointer into Secure memory to trick S into reading its own SRAM into an "input buffer" | T0 (firmware) | `NsPtr<T>` typestate validates pointer ranges against NS regions only; failure returns `NscStatus::InvalidPtr` before any deref | Bug in `ptr_validate` is a CVE class — fuzzer corpus is a tracked gap (`docs/architecture/trezor-comparison.md §2.4`) |
| TOCTOU — NS races to mutate the buffer after S validates but before S reads | T0 | Every cmd handler copies NS buffers to S-stack before parse | Untested under adversarial NS — fuzzer would catch missed paths |
| Length-confusion — NS lies about a length field to over- or under-read | T0 | Each parser validates length against the declared wire-format (e.g. `data_len ≤ 4096`) before any other byte | `data_len` is `u16 BE`, fits any sane MAX |
| NS spams gateway to drain entropy / battery | T0 | Inactivity timer is S-only; NS pings do NOT reset it. Rate limiter on USB OUT (`docs/security/production-security.md §2.4`) — planned | Battery drain is not a fund threat |
| NS panics S code via crafted input | T0 | `#![deny(clippy::indexing_slicing)]`, custom panic handler that zeroizes secrets before halting; every NSC entry returns `NscStatus` not Rust `Result` so panics cannot escape | Persistent panic = brick (DoS) — not fund-extracting |
| NS exploits a heap | — | Structurally impossible: `#![no_std]`, no allocator, no `Vec`/`Box`/`String` | None |

### 7.6 Trusted UI / display deception (blind-sign or display-vs-sign mismatch)

The single biggest attack class against hardware wallets historically: the device signs X while displaying Y. Most exploits work by giving the device unfamiliar calldata that bypasses the display pipeline.

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Companion supplies forged calldata; device shows a friendly string and signs malicious bytes | T0 | The string and the signed `userOpHash` are derived from the *same* S-stack copy. The render path *is* the hash path. | A *parser* bug that decodes one way and displays another is the residual; covered by typed-call ABI tests + EIP-712 vectors in `secure/src/tx/eip712/{cowswap,safe}/` |
| ERC-20 with a spoofed token contract address | T2 (chain) | ERC-20 metadata bundle is Merkle-verified against the firmware-baked `ERC20_DB_ROOT`; unknown tokens fall through to "⚠ BLIND SIGNING" warning | Unknown contracts still sign — user must reject blind-sign or use clear-sign |
| Hostile dapp tricks user into clear-signing wrong semantics | T0 | Native on-device decode cross-checked against the signed bytes: Safe/CoW EIP-712 verified in S-world, ERC-20 metadata + ERC-7730 descriptors Merkle-rooted into S-flash (a compromised NS cannot substitute a malicious descriptor/root). Anything undecodable falls to loud blind-sign, never a friendly-but-wrong string | Per-protocol coverage expands as a feature-add, not a security gap |
| NS fakes a "user pressed both buttons" to S | T0 (firmware) | The confirm dialog reads buttons via S-owned GPIO; NS cannot drive the GPIO. The inactivity timer is S-only TIM-driven; NS pings do not reset it. | Tamper of S-owned GPIO is a T2+ surface |
| NS races / spoofs the LCD to show a friendly screen | T0 | The NV3007 LCD SPI bus is S-owned via GTZC | TZSC enforcement silicon-validated 2026-05-20 (§9.3) |
| EIP-1271 path used to authorise arbitrary action (Replay against a different chain or wallet) | T0 | EIP-1271 verifier nests the raw hash via Solady EIP-712 with `chainId` and `address(this)` baked in; bootstrap key (`ownerIndex == 0`) forbidden on this path | Mismatch between companion's wrapping and on-device wrapping would refuse to validate — handler hashes the same way |
| **Error-mimicry / attention exhaustion** — companion engineers repeated signing ceremonies ("transaction failed, please sign again") until the user stops reading, or mutates the payload between retries | T0 | **NONE TODAY — added 2026-07-31.** A trusted display defeats display *substitution*; it does nothing against a host that manufactures the *occasion* to sign. This is the shape of the Radiant Capital compromise (Oct 2024, $50M): the front-end showed legitimate transactions while malicious payloads went to the signers, and routine-looking failure errors harvested repeat signatures across retries. Tenderly simulation showed nothing; the post-mortem records that the compromise was undetectable in manual review. | **OPEN.** Proposed mitigation is a signing-ceremony anomaly layer (repeat-prompt detector, semantic-equality retry flag, error-budget → PIN re-entry), all state S-SRAM-only so invariant #8 is untouched. Tracked in the issue tracker; not implemented, and this row must not be read as if it were. |

### 7.7 Firmware integrity (boot)

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reflash NS or S image with a malicious one | T2 | Draft 1.1 proposes FSBL verification of SPHINCS+C10 over the exact slot-bound manifest-v6 preimage; current V1 path is bench-only and production-fenced | Candidate approval, V6 implementation, physical FLASH + RAM/stack gates, and production-key ceremony remain open |
| Substitute the FSBL itself | T2 | The eventual approved FSBL range must be WRP-protected in both physical banks; the current pages-0..3 linker layout is legacy bench-only | Draft 1.1 geometry, FLASH/RAM fit, exact option bytes, factory receipt, and silicon evidence remain open (§7.11) |
| Downgrade to a vulnerable older firmware | T2 | Draft 1.1 proposes admission only for `security_epoch > rejected_through_epoch`; ordinary same-epoch releases consume no OTP | Candidate approval, physical floor codec, crash-safe establishment, capacity, and silicon evidence are OPEN; production is blocked |
| Boot a substituted image with valid old vendor sig | T2 | The vendor key is one and only one; rotating would require a vendor-key migration design we have not built | Vendor-key compromise = full break (§10.5) |
| Run a debug image with `debug-log`/`e2e-test` on a production unit | T2 | `compile_error!` fences in `nsc/mod.rs` and the `saes-self-test` runner; CI gates production on these flags OFF; user-visible measured-boot 8-BIP-39 words diverge for any feature-flag flip | Pending: vendor-pk-hash OTP lock as a second wall against feature-flag-confusion-by-reflash |

### 7.8 Firmware update channel

The legacy bench transport streams `BEGIN → CHUNK* → COMMIT` over `CMD_FW_*`
with PIN unlock required on every command. Its `PQFW_V1` preimage and rollback
backend are production-fenced. Draft 1.1 proposes an exact 121-byte,
slot-bound `PQFW_V6` preimage plus typed marker/selector/floor interfaces, but
is not implementation-approved; the physical and resource backends remain OPEN.

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Inject a chunk mid-stream | T0 | Chunks accumulate into staging area; COMMIT verifies SHA-256 of staged image against the signed hashes before any write to active flash | None |
| MITM the update bytes | T0 | Sig binds to `secure_hash` and `nonsecure_hash` — bit-flip of any byte fails verify | None |
| Replay an old signed update | T0 | Target selector/floor rejects retired security epochs and orders releases within an epoch | Replacement backend not yet implemented; legacy path must not ship |
| Glitch the COMMIT verify | T3 | FI sentinels on the verify pass; double-checked verify; ITAMP9 (planned) catches crypto-peripheral fault | Untested at production hardness |
| Brick by mid-update power loss | T2 (accidental) | Target contract preserves the confirmed fallback through PENDING/ATTEMPTED and establishes the floor only after CONFIRMED | Unimplemented journal/ECC/OTP recovery is production-blocking; legacy floor ordering can retire the unchanged fallback |

### 7.9 Fault injection (FI)

The Masaryk U Simonik 2024/2025 thesis (76% PIN-glitch on STM32U5A9, same Cortex-M33 family as ours) means we *do not* treat the U5 as glitch-immune. Defence stacks per `docs/security/production-security.md §2.1`.

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voltage / EMFI glitch to skip the PIN-check branch | T3 | Fail-in pattern (`if remaining != 0, continue; else wipe`); MCU page-124 pre-commit before SE driver call; FihInt complement-storage (0x1AAA_AAAA / 0x1555_5555) on `pin_verified`, `blob_cached`, `match_ok` | Tested against home-equipment glitching; not yet against state-actor lab |
| SLH-DSA single-fault grafting (Genêt 2023) | T3 | Double-compute on disjoint SRAM regions + constant-time compare; signature released only on byte-equal match | RFC 9814 §5 explicitly endorses double-compute as the only defence; verify-after-sign alone is insufficient |
| Skip the on-chain cap check via glitch (off-target) | — | The cap is enforced in Solidity at on-chain execution; the device cannot be glitched into producing a sig that the chain accepts past the cap | Chain is the authority for the cap; device-side glitch cannot loosen it |
| ITAMP-class crypto-peripheral fault (SAES/PKA/TRNG glitch) | T3 | Planned ITAMP9 enable wires SAES/AES/PKA/TRNG fault detection to `trigger_lockout_wipe()` per Trezor `tamper.c:140-166` pattern | PRE-PROD-CAVEAT: TAMP driver currently log-only — `tamp` feature flag must flip to wipe before production |
| Rowhammer-on-bus equivalents | T3 | SRAM2/SRAM3 ECC option bytes (Stage-2 brownout hardening) | Pending option-byte flip on factory line |
| Random-delay glitch sentinel (`wait_random` style) | T3 | Planned — Trezor `random_delays.c:186-202` pattern with the double-invariant `i + j == wait` under volatile pair | Tracked in `docs/architecture/trezor-comparison.md §2.6` |

### 7.10 Side-channel analysis (SCA)

`Saarinen "SLotH" CRYPTO 2024` reports catastrophic horizontal-DPA leakage of `PRF(SK.seed)` on unprotected Cortex-M33. The U585 HASH peripheral provides **zero** DPA protection (per ST UM3370) — it's a timing / performance accelerator, not an SCA defence.

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Horizontal DPA on signing power trace to recover `SK.seed` | T3 | OptRand mandatory — 16-byte fresh per-signature randomness breaks chosen-message PRF recovery; WOTS+/FORS shuffling (Fisher-Yates, TRNG-seeded) breaks trace alignment; consumption mask (TIM2 CH1 PWM, `hw/consumption_mask.rs`) randomises the power footprint | Software SHA-256 masking is a long-tail item; HASH peripheral has no DPA resistance |
| Template attack on SHA-256 hot loop | T3 | Same — consumption mask + OptRand + shuffling. Production C10 keygen is ~ 7 s (long SCA window); slot keygen ~ 1 s | Untested at lab hardness |
| Cache-timing leakage of secret-dependent branches | T3 | `#![deny(clippy::indexing_slicing)]`, `subtle` for constant-time compare, no secret-dependent branches in `sphincs-c10/` (audit-reviewed line-by-line) | New code touching secrets must be audited the same way; tracked as a permanent review gate |
| EM SCA from outside the case | T3 | Consumption mask + the deliberate non-determinism of OptRand; EM is harder than power for an unshielded board but possible | A skilled lab is the residual |
| Rate-limit / signature quota | T3 (mitigates) | Signing rate-limit + hard rotate after 2^16 signatures per key (on-chain cap is a belt-and-braces here) | None |

### 7.11 Chip swap, clone, and supply chain

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mid-transit swap of OPTIGA | T2 / T6 | Boot-time attestation: fresh nonce → OPTIGA ECDSA-signs with `0xE0F0`, cert chains to Infineon Trust M Root CA 2; per-die UID at OID `0xE0C2` compared against factory-pinned value (planned binding manifest, `docs/security/production-security.md §2.5`) | PRE-PROD-CAVEAT: per-device binding manifest not yet landed |
| Mid-transit swap of SE050 | T2 / T6 | Same shape with SE050 attestation via `Se05x_API_ReadObject_W_Attst`; chipId at IDENTIFY compared against factory-pinned; **variant constraint** — only SE050 C/E/F have factory attestation certs at OID `0xF0000013`; A/B/D do not. We use C-class. | PRE-PROD-CAVEAT: per-device binding manifest not yet landed |
| Mid-transit swap of STM32 (recap'd remarked chip) | T2 | Anti-counterfeit probes — CPUID/DBGMCU_IDCODE expected r0p4/`0x482`; UID register validated (lot ASCII range, wafer < 25, not all-0/all-FF); DHUK probe via SAES against factory-recorded fingerprint; ICACHE/DCACHE Stop-mode quirk fingerprints | Tracked in `docs/security/production-security.md §2.5`; specific bit positions need cross-check vs ES0499 |
| Clone with valid-looking attestation from a stolen factory HSM key | T6 | Per-device binding record stored 3× (STM32 flash wrapped, SE050 object 0x10000001, OPTIGA OID 0xF1D1); SHA-256 anchor written to OTP bytes 6-37; transparency-log Merkle anchor (planned) catches devices missing from log | Until transparency log lands, a single HSM compromise can produce valid devices. Plan = SLH-DSA-128s factory manifest under M-of-N HSM ceremony |
| Pre-first-boot intercept (flash a key-exfiltrating stub, boot once, restore real FW) | T6 | Defence stack: secure-boot chain + tamper-evident packaging + WebUSB box-opening ceremony at `verify.pqsigner.io` that re-verifies all three UIDs + manifest sig + firmware hash | Honest residual — the factory supplies only OTP-master-derived transport credentials, while final SE050 keys derive from the post-lock BHK and final OPTIGA PBS from post-lock DHUK plus fresh salt. **ADOPTED 2026-07-14 (work-todo #36):** devices ship at RDP-0 so anyone can SWD-verify flash/option-bytes/OTP before first power; secure-app early boot self-locks to RDP-2 before final rotation. Non-verifying users stay exposed to a transit reflash-and-self-lock — tamper-evident fulfillment + #22 are the mitigations |
| Compromised provisioning station | T6 | Clean-room provisioning; HSM-backed per-device key generation; per-device transparency-log entry catches rogue runs | A compromise window taints every device that passes through it during the window |
| Chip swap **after** the user owns the device | T2 | After provisioning, each chip's UID is pinned to MCU flash; on next boot a swapped chip fails attestation → permanent lockdown | Untested in mainline boot today (boot-time attestation is planned, not landed) — PRE-PROD-CAVEAT §9.4 |

### 7.12 On-chain (smart-wallet / replay / forgery)

The on-chain contracts (`PQSmartWallet`, `PQSmartWalletFactory`, `PQMultiOwnable`, `verifiers/SPHINCsC10Asm`) are part of the trust path: a bug in the verifier is a fund-equivalent break.

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Forge a C10 sig that the on-chain verifier accepts | T7 | Verifier is the canonical stateless C10 verify (Yul-coded, single immutable for all three paths). Reviewed; covered by `forge test -vv`; differential-tested against the host-side Rust verifier | A novel break in SPHINCS+C10 is a research event — see §10.6 |
| Submit a Type 1 sig whose bootstrap key wasn't ever provisioned | T0 | Bootstrap pubkey is pinned in `initCode` via CREATE2 salt commitment; mismatched bootstrap pubkey ⇒ CREATE2-derived address ≠ `sender` ⇒ EntryPoint rejects | Structurally impossible at the protocol layer |
| Re-use a Type 2 sig across two UserOps (replay) | T0 | UserOpHash binds chain_id (via EIP-712), nonce (monotonic), `sender`, entryPoint, calldata. Two distinct UserOps ⇒ two distinct hashes | None |
| Use an EIP-1271 `isValidSignature` path to authorise a UserOp | T0 | `validateUserOp` ABI-decodes `SignatureWrapper` and dispatches by `ownerIndex`; the EIP-1271 view function is a different entry, returns the magic / null bytes only, never bumps counters | None |
| Authorise EIP-1271 with the bootstrap key (`ownerIndex == 0`) | T0 | `isValidSignature` explicitly rejects `ownerIndex == 0` (one-sentence guard) | None |
| Exhaust off-chain counter to roll back a slot | T0 | `executeWithOffchainCount` enforces monotonic update of `offchainSigCount[i]` + re-checks combined cap inside the execution phase | None |
| Sign EIP-1271 for a slot that was never registered (post-restore on a new chain) | T0 | Firmware-side `CMD_SIGN_OFFCHAIN` refuses if slot is unregistered for `(account_index, chain_id)`; forces a Type 1 rotation via `CMD_SIGN_USEROP` first | None |
| Cross-chain key replay | T0 | Slot keys are chain-bound (Claim 5); the same `slot_index` on a different chain yields a different pubkey | None |
| Migrate to a v0.7/v0.8 EntryPoint | — | Architecturally forbidden: same 24 words → same address on every chain depends on the v0.6 EntryPoint address baked into `initCode`, the userOpHash preimage, and the factory. If v0.6 bundlers sunset, fall back to direct EOA-bundled execution against the same wallet | Frozen by Claim 6 / Invariant #6 in CLAUDE.md |
| Bundler / paymaster front-runs to drain | — | UserOp execution semantics protect against re-ordering; paymaster only sponsors gas, cannot modify call payload | None at the protocol layer |
| MEV / sandwich attack on a transaction | T0 | Out of scope — wallet signs what user confirms. MEV is a dapp / chain-level concern, not a wallet concern | Not a fund-extraction class against the wallet |

### 7.13 USB and host-side compromise

USB is the only external interface and the primary T0 attack vector. The host is **untrusted by design** — we treat the companion app the same way a CA treats a TLS client.

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Malicious companion forges signing requests | T0 | Every signed payload reaches the user's eyes on the trusted UI before any signing key is touched; user must confirm via S-owned buttons. The trusted display IS the signing oracle (§7.6) | User must actually read the screen — UX residual |
| **Companion DISTRIBUTION channel compromised** (not the companion's logic) | T0/T6 | Partly structural: the device decodes and renders from its own S-stack copy, so a poisoned companion cannot change what the screen says. The Ledger Connect Kit incident (Dec 2023) is the reference shape — a phished npm session token shipped three poisoned versions of a library embedded in hundreds of dApp front-ends for ~5 hours, and the poison persisted on CDN caches after the npm fix. The devices were never compromised; the channel between user and device was. | **PARTIAL — added 2026-07-31.** T0 already models a "supply-chain-compromised npm package on the dapp side" (§4), so the class is in-model; what is NOT covered is our own companion's release path: reproducible companion builds, release attestations, SRI/lockfile pinning, maintainer hardware-2FA and session-token hygiene. The residual is that a user cross-checks the device screen against what a poisoned companion told them to expect. |
| ZLP race / DWC2 TxFIFO atomicity (ES0499 §2.26.x) leaks stale FIFO data from a prior session | T0 (device side) | Driver enforces single-packet transfers (`DIEPTSIZ.XFRSIZ = DIEPCTL.MPSIZ`), no interleaving in ISR, flushes all FIFOs on USB reset (`GRSTCTL.RXFFLSH \| TXFFLSH` with TXFNUM=0x10) | Confirm against ES0499 Rev 11 — research-cited sub-section numbers partially verified |
| Stuck-NS via flood of OUT reports | T0 | **CORRECTED 2026-07-31 — the token bucket this row used to describe does not exist.** It was **DESCOPED-WITH-RATIONALE 2026-05-28** (a frame-level ~200 reports/s cap false-trips legitimate APDU-chained transfers: one 8 KB `FW_BEGIN` manifest fans out to ~33 chained `seq=0` frames in ~165 ms, i.e. right at the cap — see [`work-todo` archive](../archive/work-todo-retired-2026-07-19.md) "HID OUT rate limiter"). What actually covers this today: (1) **DWC2 RX-FIFO hardware NAK backpressure** — USB-level flow control the device cannot be overrun through; (2) the **F-17 sign-rate limiter** (`secure/src/sign_rate.rs`, 1 sig/s + 250/session) plus the PIN gate on the only expensive path; (3) malformed frames are dropped by the assembler in µs. | Battery / DoS only. **Note the IWDG is NOT a backstop for this case**: a live flood keeps the NS main loop *running*, so the heartbeat keeps being published and IWDG never fires — IWDG detects a **stalled** loop, not a **flooded** one. Re-open a bucket only if profiling shows a USB-level DoS that RX-FIFO backpressure does not absorb. |
| Buffer overflow in APDU reassembly | T0 | Bounded APDU reassembly: `4 ≤ declared_len ≤ 4096` at seq=0; 5 s timeout with buffer scrub; abort if seq=0 arrives mid-reassembly | Fuzz coverage is a tracked gap (`docs/architecture/trezor-comparison.md §2.4`) |
| EMFI on `min()` length-clamping (Colin O'Flynn WOOT 2019) | T3 | FI-resistant `fi_min` pattern (`if r > a \|\| r > b { return min }`); post-transfer assert `DIEPTSIZ.XFRSIZ` did not exceed declared length | Production hardness untested |
| Host-side keylogger captures PIN typing | T5 (effectively) | The PIN is **never** typed on the host. PIN entry is via on-device buttons through the trusted UI dialog (`secure/src/ui/pin_entry.rs`). The host never sees a PIN byte. | None — the host is never on the PIN path |
| BadUSB injects HID keystrokes simultaneously | T1 | Device buttons are S-owned GPIO — host cannot synthesize button presses. NS code reading buttons is irrelevant since the S-only confirm dialog reads them itself | None |
| Migration to OTG_HS (which has DMA) | — | Architectural ban — we use OTG_FS deliberately so all USB data is CPU-mediated and GTZC/TZ protections apply to every byte | Tracked invariant — do not migrate |

### 7.14 Quantum (CRQC)

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shor against classical signature in the trust path | T7 | None exist. All signatures are SPHINCS+C10. | None |
| Shor against SE classical channel keys captured from historical traffic | T7 | Not applicable — both SE channels key from *pre-shared symmetric* roots (per-device PBS / SCP03 statics); no key agreement crosses the bus, so a capture contains no Shor target. The correct quantum attack is Grover key search on the AES-128 session key: ~2⁶⁴ serial ops per captured session (Cat 1), physical tap required, both tunnels needed (XOR split). | ACCEPTED §9.1 (owner, 2026-07-07); conditional on per-device key rotation (§9.2) — no forward secrecy in either KDF |
| Grover against 128-bit symmetric primitives | T7 | All symmetric primitives sized so Grover leaves ≥ 128-bit effective. AES-256, SHA-256, HMAC-SHA256 all qualify | None |
| Grover-on-hash against the SPHINCS+C10 preimage | T7 | C10 is sized as SHA-256-based at the post-Grover effective level | None |
| Quantum key search against the device's per-slot `slot_entropy` | T7 | `slot_entropy` is a 256-bit SHA-256 output — quantum search effective bit-strength = 128 bits | None |

### 7.15 Physical destructive (decap, microprobe, FIB)

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Decap STM32 to probe device roots / candidate OTP state | T4 | DHUK is SAES-only; the target BHK is DHUK-wrapped and becomes "must keep code running on this specific device." The factory OTP master is transport-only; its legacy field-auto-burn/final-root use is production-rejected. Candidate rollback/vendor OTP records are non-secret but integrity-critical. | Tier-4 lab is the residual for silicon roots; candidate OTP authority remains blocked pending its backend and ceremony. Cost is dominated by single-shot per-device destructive work. |
| Decap OPTIGA to extract `half_O` | T4 | EAL 6+ rated; without `half_E` extraction the seed is XOR-blind | Two-chip decap is the brute-force lower bound |
| Decap SE050 to extract `half_E` | T4 | EAL 6+ rated; same as above | Two-chip decap is the brute-force lower bound |
| FIB read of TAMP backup registers (BHK) | T4 | Post-Stage 2 — TAMP-BHK with `TAMP_SECCFGR.BHKLOCK` makes BHK SAES-only; FIB on TAMP backup registers is the residual surface | Tier-4, single-shot per device |

**What "EAL 6+ rated" above does and does not cover** (added 2026-07-17; see
[`docs/verification/hardware-assumption-boundary-2026-07-17.md`](../verification/hardware-assumption-boundary-2026-07-17.md)
§1(e) and `HW-ASSUME-SE-INTERNALS` / `HW-ASSUME-SE050-CERT-VERSION` in
[`HW_ASSUMPTIONS.json`](../../contracts/verification/docs/HW_ASSUMPTIONS.json)):

- **The decap rows are within scope.** Physical attack resistance of the die *is* what these
  certificates evaluate, which is why the citation belongs on exactly these two rows and nowhere
  else in this document.
- **OPTIGA — the boundary is sharp.** BSI-DSZ-CC-0961 (EAL6+/ALC_FLR.1) covers the **IC platform**:
  hardware, IC dedicated software, and the Infineon crypto libraries, on a 16-bit
  Intel-80251-compatible core. The Trust M **applet** — its object/OID model, access conditions,
  `LcsO` lifecycle, and the Shielded Connection — is IC *Embedded Software*, **above** the certified
  boundary; the report assigns application data handling to the environment (`OE.Resp-Appl`). So no
  row anywhere may read "discharged by EAL6+" for an OID/AC/LcsO/shielded property. Cite the current
  certificate version, not V4-2019, which **expired 2024-12-17**.
- **SE050 is genuinely stronger.** NSCIB-CC-180212-CR5's TOE includes the JCVM/JCRE/JCAPI — the layer
  that enforces our UserID PIN policy. It explicitly does **not** rate cryptographic protocol
  strength, so it does not cover SCP03-as-deployed. And which configuration we actually hold is
  itself unconfirmed (`HW-ASSUME-SE050-CERT-VERSION`).
- **A certificate is bounded expert effort, not a proof.** EUCLEAK is the standing refutation: a
  non-constant-time modular inversion in the Infineon cryptolib went unnoticed for *"14 years and
  about 80 highest-level Common Criteria certification evaluations"* (NinjaLab). Demonstrated on a
  YubiKey 5Ci (SLE78); NinjaLab reports the vulnerability "extends to" OPTIGA Trust M — suspected,
  not demonstrated, on our part. Not a live exposure for us regardless: invariant #5 means we never
  invoke OPTIGA's ECDSA (the driver has no asymmetric ops at all).

### 7.16 Coercion

| Attack | Tier | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rubber-hose ($5 wrench) | T5 | Architecturally **out of scope** (HARDENING §13.1) | Plain truth: no PIN-gated system survives coercion |
| Shoulder-surf during PIN entry | T5 | On-device button entry without echo; minimum PIN length; eventual progressive delay between attempts (in S-world before the SCP03 handshake) | None besides UX |
| Duress PIN / decoy wallet | T5 | Not currently implemented; architectural option per HARDENING §5.3 | If shipped, would let users hand over a low-value subset under coercion |

## 8. Cross-cutting Invariants (do not regress)

These are the load-bearing invariants. The numbered list mirrors CLAUDE.md "Non-Negotiable Invariants" — repeated here so the threat-model document is self-contained and so each invariant carries its threat-model justification.

1. **Dual-chip seed split.** Defends Claim 1. Defeats single-chip-vendor-class breaks (Ledger Donjon March 2025 on Trezor Safe 3 is a single-chip break; harmless under our split).
2. **Hardware PIN gating, three-way per-attempt consumption.** Defends Claim 3. Defeats software-side PIN-compare bugs; boot reconciliation remains the narrower directional page124/E120 check.
3. **E2E encrypted SE tunnels.** Defends §7.2 row 1. Defeats unaided I²C bus snoop and replay.
4. **All secrets only in TrustZone secure world.** Defends §7.5 and §7.3 row 2. Defeats every NS-side firmware compromise from being seed-extracting.
5. **One signature primitive: SPHINCS+C10.** Defends Claim 7 (no classical signature in the trust path) and Claim 4 (no second verifier to backdoor). Defeats Shor against the signing path.
6. **Bootstrap C10 keys immutable per-wallet.** Defends Claim 6 cross-chain address stability. Defeats a class of "rotate to a new key" social-engineering scams.
7. **Per-chain caps monotonic, unresettable.** Defends Claim 6 / §7.12. Defeats off-chain rollback / reset attacks.
8. **Stateless slot selection.** Defeats per-signature flash-state corruption attacks — the only per-signature flash state is the page-123 EIP-1271 counter; everything else is companion-supplied and re-derived in SRAM.
9. **Off-chain sig counter, combined cap.** Defeats EIP-1271 over-spending; defeats post-restore unregistered-slot signing.

**F3 residual — page-123 compaction crash-atomicity.** The page-123 off-chain
counter store is a log-structured journal compacted in place (erase-then-replay,
single page, no two-phase staging), so a physical power-loss / reset timed
*inside* the compaction window can tear it. Because "slot registered" is derived
from "≥1 journal entry exists", a tear could leave a slot registered with a
counter rolled back. This is **physical-fault-only** (not companion-reachable —
it needs a precisely-timed reset during compaction). The compaction now replays
the unbounded, no-on-chain-backstop `USEROP_SIGS` few-time tally **first** per
slot (`flash.rs::compact_page`), so the security-critical "registered but
few-time tally rolled back" state is unreachable: a tear before it leaves the
slot *unregistered* (invariant #9 forces a Type-1 re-registration), and a tear
after can only roll back the COUNT/USEROP counters, which are bounded by the
firmware gap ≤ `MAX_OFFCHAIN_GAP` and backstopped by the on-chain
`_setOffchainSigCount`/`slotUses` monotonicity. The remaining bounded
COUNT/USEROP roll-back, and full crash-atomicity via a two-page ping-pong /
commit marker, are tracked as a hardening follow-up. The **on-chain** caps
(invariant #7) are unaffected — they live in contract storage, not flash.

**SOL6 design note — cross-slot `removeOwnerAtIndex` authorization (owner
management).** In `PQSmartWallet._validateSignature`, the H-3 ownerIndex-parity
check (calldata's first arg must equal the signed wrapper `ownerIndex`) is
**deliberately skipped for the `removeOwnerAtIndex` selector** — its first arg is
a *removal* index, not the signer's index. The consequence is that any active
slot key at index *i* ≥ 1 can sign `removeOwnerAtIndex(j, ownerBytes_j)` for any
*other* non-bootstrap slot *j* ≥ 1 (`ownerAtIndex(j)` is a public getter, so the
`ownerBytes_j` argument is not secret). This is an **intra-wallet availability**
property, **not fund theft**: a removed slot cannot move funds, the bootstrap
owner (index 0) is `removeOwnerAtIndex`-unremovable (`_removeOwnerAtIndex`
rejects index 0), and the bootstrap key can re-add any pruned slot, so recovery
holds. It is surfaced here for completeness — the code comment in
`_validateSignature` indicates it is intended, and the behavior is **pinned by
`test_sol6_crossSlotRemoveIsAcceptedByDesign`** so a future decision to bind
*i == j* for the remove selector is a deliberate change, not a silent
regression. Whether "any slot may prune any other slot" should be tightened to
"a slot may only remove itself" (binding *i == j*) is an **open design decision**
for the owner-management model; it does not affect `theft_free`
(no fund movement) and would require re-freezing the wallet codehash.

The hardening regressions that knowingly violate one or more of these are listed in §9.

---

## 9. Pre-Production Caveats (knowingly live regressions)

Each item here is a regression we accept *only* on the bring-up branch. CI gates production builds against them.

### 9.1 ML-KEM-1024 inner wrap — DESCOPED; residual ACCEPTED (owner decision 2026-07-07)
*Affects Claim 7 only on captured bus traffic.* No longer a pre-prod caveat to close: the owner accepted the bus-capture residual permanently. `half_O` and `half_E` cross I²C under the SE channels' AES-128 session encryption; since both channels are symmetric-rooted (no handshake on the wire), the strongest quantum attack on a capture is Grover-2⁶⁴ per session with a physical tap during a live unlock, twice over (XOR split) — Category 1, the system's uniform floor. The earlier wording here ("break the channel key agreement") overstated the exposure; with per-device statics there is no key agreement to break. **Load-bearing condition:** per-device SCP03/PBS rotation (§9.2) — neither KDF has forward secrecy, so leaked/fleet-default statics make a tapped session classically decryptable (one half only; contained by Claim 1). The prototype implementation (hybrid ML-KEM-1024 + HMAC(HUK) + AES-256-GCM, QEMU-validated) is retained behind off-by-default features with production fences — see `docs/security/ml-kem-inner-wrap.md` and work-todo #9 for the decision record.

### 9.2 Factory provisioning (per-device SCP03 + PBS) is not yet automated
*Affects Claim 2 against any device that has not been rotated.* The first-boot self-provisioning flow (work-todo #36 — devices ship at RDP-0 with factory-installed, OTP-master-derived *transport* credentials; secure-app early boot self-locks to RDP-2; SE050 rotates to unsalted BHK-rooted final SCP03/admin credentials; OPTIGA rotates to a final DHUK + page-127-salt PBS) is **device-side implemented 2026-07-14** behind feature `rdp2-self-lock` (host-tested; silicon-validation and protocol-closure pending — see `docs/provisioning/first-boot-provisioning.md`). Until it is approved, silicon-validated, and shipping, bench boards may use published/default or development credentials. **Pre-production only.** No shipping device passes QA without the factory transport-keyset install, and no device is user-ready until its first-boot rotation completes.

### 9.3 TZSC peripheral allowlist is regressed to all-NS
*Affects Invariant #4.* `secure/src/sau.rs` clears `GTZC1_TZSC_SECCFGR{1,2,3}` to 0 because USB OTG FS is on AHB2 (governed by GTZC2 — base address not yet confirmed; first guess bus-faulted). I²C1 / AES / HASH / PKA / SAES / RNG reachable from NS until restored. Fix: adopt Trezor's per-peripheral S-allowlist (`docs/architecture/trezor-comparison.md §1.1`).

### 9.4 Boot-time SE attestation is not yet landed
*Affects §7.11 — chip-swap defence is provisioning-time only today, not runtime-recurring.* The full binding manifest + boot-time triple-UID verification per `docs/security/production-security.md §2.5` is the production gate.

### 9.5 TAMP IRQ handler is log-only
*Affects FI residual in §7.9.* `secure/src/hw/tamp.rs` currently logs on tamper events rather than invoking `trigger_lockout_wipe()`. The Trezor `tamper.c:140-166` pattern (ITAMP1-3, ITAMP5-9, ITAMP11) needs to be ported and the IRQ handler must wipe before production.

### 9.6 Debug logging may ship in this branch
`debug-log` allowed on hardware in current bring-up; `secure_log!` in the wizard; NS pre-USB register dumps; DHCSR-gated semihosting prints in `hw::hash::init_clock`. CI must gate production on `debug-log` / `e2e-test` / `mock-se` / `otp-hardcoded-master-key` / `ui-capture` OFF. The `compile_error!` fences in `nsc/mod.rs` and the `saes-self-test` runner enforce most of this.

### 9.7 Domain-separation tags are sticky-but-renamable
The tag `"sphincs-c6-v1"` is historical (was a different parameter set when written; now C10). Do not rename mid-bring-up (re-provisions every bench board); coordinated cleanup pre-launch is fine. **PROD-INVARIANT after first shipment** — once a device exists with funds, the tag is frozen forever (Invariant #6 cross-chain address stability depends on it).

### 9.8 Vendor-pubkey OTP hash lock is not yet burned
A re-flashed FSBL today could substitute a different vendor key and the device would not refuse. Defence: `FLASH_OTP_BLOCK_VENDOR_PK_HASH` per `docs/architecture/trezor-comparison.md §1.2`. Production gate.

### 9.9 MPU privilege-banking is absent
S-world has one privilege tier. Any S-world code can call `secret_keys::derive_into{,_bhk}`. The Trezor pattern (`secure_aes` exposes key-selectors at two privilege tiers + MPU `MODE_APP_SAES` band) raises the bar to "an exploitable S-world bug must also be in privileged-S, not just any-S." Hardening-pass item, not a bring-up blocker.

---

## 10. Residual Risks (out of scope / unmitigated)

The following are *honestly* out of scope. Listing them is the point — a threat model that omits its boundary is propaganda.

### 10.1 Coercion (T5)
No PIN-gated system survives a user being compelled to unlock it. Architecturally fixable only with multi-party approval (e.g. m-of-n co-signers, off-device for the rest); we do not currently ship that.

### 10.2 Two simultaneous decap-class breaks (T4 + T4)
Even with the dual-SE split, a state-actor lab that destructively decaps *both* the OPTIGA and the SE050 of the same device, defeats the silicon-anchored PIN gate inside each (10-attempt cap is per-chip per-physical-device; SE silicon PIN compare is destructive on failure), and reconstructs both halves recovers the seed. Cost: hundreds of thousand-dollar per-device, destructive. Out of scope.

### 10.3 Vendor HSM compromise (T6)
If the SPHINCS+C10 vendor signing key is extracted from the off-device HSM, an attacker can sign arbitrary firmware updates. Defence is HSM-based custody + M-of-N ceremony (planned for the binding-manifest factory key); production deployment plan must apply the same custody to the firmware-signing key. The on-device boot path verifies the signature; it has no defence against a legitimate-looking signature from the vendor key.

### 10.4 Supply-chain compromise pre-first-boot (T6)
A device intercepted between factory and unboxing, with the case opened and a different firmware flashed, can try to consume the genuine first-field transition or install attacker-chosen post-lock state before the owner verifies it. The OTP transport master is already factory-burned, but the BHK first-write and OPTIGA salt generation occur on the device, so running an attacker image first remains the relevant risk. Defence stack: secure-boot chain + tamper-evident packaging + WebUSB box-opening ceremony at `verify.pqsigner.io` that re-verifies all three UIDs + manifest sig + firmware hash. The defence is *not* purely cryptographic; it includes a procedural + UX honesty layer.

### 10.5 Quantum-relevant break of SHA-256
Grover halves the effective bit strength of any preimage / hash search. We size all symmetric primitives to 256 bits so the post-Grover effective is 128 bits, which is the accepted PQ-symmetric baseline. A *novel* break of SHA-256 collision resistance or preimage resistance below √n is out of scope.

### 10.6 Cryptanalytic break of SPHINCS+C10
A novel attack on the SPHINCS+ family — beyond the well-understood single-fault grafting that we defend with double-compute — would be a research event. We track NIST PQC announcements; the C10 parameter set is the FIPS-205 round-3 finalist at our chosen security level. No known break below the parameter-set's design security.

### 10.7 MEV / front-running / on-chain ordering attacks
Out of scope of the wallet. The wallet signs what the user confirms on the trusted UI; chain-level ordering / sandwiching is a dapp / chain-level concern. Mitigation lives in dapp UX (slippage limits in calldata that the trusted UI displays correctly via §7.6), not in the wallet.

### 10.8 Privacy / deanonymisation (S7)
A passive on-chain observer can correlate a wallet's deterministic CREATE2 address across chains. The same 24 words → same address on every chain is a *feature* (recovery UX); the privacy cost is acknowledged. Mitigation must come from off-device tooling (per-tx address rotation requires breaking Claim 6, which we explicitly do not do).

### 10.9 Stuck-in-display-pipeline bugs
If a future contract uses ABI patterns the typed-call parser doesn't handle, the user sees "⚠ BLIND SIGNING" and signs at their own risk. We do not ship a typed-call parser that decodes unfamiliar ABIs into friendly strings without a firmware-pinned descriptor / Merkle-verified binding (§7.6). This is a *feature* — refusing to invent a display is safer than inventing one wrongly.

### 10.10 Bugs in our dependencies
`sphincs-c10/` and `bip39/` are in-tree and reviewed line-by-line. Every external crate that touches secrets is pinned and reviewed. Despite that, "every shipped wallet vulnerability in history" is implementation bug. The honest residual is: an implementation bug in a code path we have not yet audited or that lands post-audit is the most likely failure mode. Mitigation = external audit before shipping + bug bounty + gradual rollout, per HARDENING §12.

## 11. Empirical Verification

These are tests that *back* threat-model claims, not just unit tests. Each is reproducible from the Makefile.

| Test | Falsifies | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `make e2e` | Gateway sign path under mock SEs in QEMU | Passing |
| `make e2e-hw` | Gateway sign path on real STM32U585 + dual-SE | Passing 2026-05-12 |
| `make pin-gate-hw-counter-e2e` | Claim 3 — three-way per-attempt consumption, in-run desynchronization recovery, and simulated cache resynchronization; no reboot/reconcile coverage | Passing for stated scope |
| Cold-reboot page124/E120 reconciliation on silicon (target not yet implemented) | Claim 3 boot edge — exact E120-leading state wipes before unlock/gateway exposure; exact MCU-leading state cold-boots without wiping and preserves the conservatively charged MCU debt | **OPEN — not implemented or run; requires a fresh owner-authorized sacrificial part** |
| `make pin-gate-wipe-e2e` | Claim 3 — 10-wrong factory wipe + page-124 erase | Passing |
| `make se050-admin-extract-attempt-e2e` | Claim 2 — admin can DELETE but not READ user-PIN-gated secrets on SE050 | Passing 2026-05-11 |
| `make saes-self-test-hw` | SAES driver + DHUK round-trip + 8-byte fingerprint cross-board consistency | Passing |
| `make optiga-hw-counter-e2e` | OPTIGA E120 LUC + F1D0 binding | Passing |
| `forge test -vv` (in `contracts/smart-wallet`) | Claims 4, 5, 6 on-chain | Passing |
| `cargo test -p sphincs-tz-secure --tests --release` | Pure-logic primitives, NIST PQC test vectors | Passing |
| `make test-key-speed` | DWT-timed signing bench; SCA-window characterisation | Passing |

Tests that *should* exist but don't yet:

- libFuzzer / cargo-fuzz harnesses against `parse_cmd_sign_userop_input(&[u8])` and the APDU parser (`docs/architecture/trezor-comparison.md §2.4`).
- An analogous `make optiga-admin-extract-attempt-e2e` mirroring the SE050 test for Claim 2's OPTIGA side.
- A scripted FI sweep — voltage glitch on the PIN-verify branch — even at home-equipment hardness, to characterise residual against §7.4 / §7.9.
- Zeroization-verification SRAM scan after every signing test (HARDENING §11).
- Screenshot-hash UI regression covering every confirm-dialog state, including blind-sign and the native clear-sign paths (`docs/architecture/trezor-comparison.md §2.3`).

### 11.4 Known-attack regression matrix (added 2026-07-31)

Every publicly documented hardware-wallet attack should exist here as a named
test, bench sweep, or design note — not as folklore. The citations below are
**not** re-derived: they are the ones already fact-checked, with hallucinations
adjudicated, in [`production-security.md`](production-security.md) §"research
round citation audit". Cite through that table, not through this one.

| Historical attack | Class | Our status | The specific missing piece |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rashid vs Ledger Nano S (2018) — MCU↔SE isolation bypass | Architecture | Dual-SE XOR split; no single chip holds the seed | **Do not state this as "keys never on the MCU"**: unlock reconstructs full entropy in Secure SRAM and caches slot secrets there for the signing window (`dual_se.rs`, `nsc/state.rs`). The split defeats single-chip extraction and at-rest compromise, *not* a compromised secure-world image — measured boot + RDP-2 + TrustZone are what answer that |
| wallet.fail vs Trezor (35C3, 2018) — FI during FW-update RAM staging | Fault + update flow | Sentinel FI gates in `fw_update`, measured boot, panic/reset zeroization | **No sweep injects during the staging window.** `tools/sca/` has 13 `fault_sweep_*.py` and none targets the CHUNK-accumulate → COMMIT-verify transition — filed as its own issue |
| Kraken Security Labs vs Trezor One / Model T (2020) — RDP-downgrade glitch, ~$75, 15 min | Fault + config | `rdp2-self-lock`, TAMP wipe, PIN-in-SE, no seed in MCU flash | Per-unit option-byte attestation (the bench unit is not unit #4,312); U585 glitch replication |
| Castelnovi/Genêt grafting trees vs SPHINCS signing (2018–2023) | Algorithmic fault | Double-compute + CT compare + verify-before-release + relock (`crypto.rs`), RFC 9814 §5 cited in §6.3 | Bench quantification of the *correlated*-fault residual (same fault in both passes) |
| Colin O'Flynn "MIN()imum Failure" (WOOT 2019) | FI on length clamps | `fi_min` pattern + post-transfer `DIEPTSIZ` assert (§7.13) | Production hardness untested on silicon |
| μ-Glitch (USENIX Sec 2023) — 4-fault TrustZone-M bypass | FI on TZ | SAU/GTZC config silicon-validated 2026-05-20 | Multi-fault model is not covered by the current single-injection sweeps |
| TROPIC01 laser FI bypass of signature verification (2026) | SE fault | The lesson *is* our design: the authorization decision sits behind a silicon boundary, and that chip's secret store survived full CPU compromise | Extend bench LFI/EMFI to our SE command paths, within disclosure norms |
| Ledger Connect Kit (Dec 2023) — poisoned library in dApp front-ends | Companion supply chain | Device renders from its own S-stack copy | Our companion's own release path — see the new §7.13 row |
| Radiant Capital (Oct 2024) — display-legit / sign-malicious + error-mimicry harvesting | Host + human | Trusted display defeats the substitution half | The harvesting half — see the new §7.6 row |
| TrapDoor (2026) — `build.rs` malware, `CLAUDE.md` persistence | Supply chain / AI | `cargo-deny` sources+bans, `cargo-vet`; **CODEOWNERS on AI-instruction files and an invisible-Unicode gate landed 2026-07-31** | Zero-day-malicious dependency detection (behavioural, not advisory-DB) |
| Address poisoning / homoglyph phishing (ongoing) | UX | Stronger than the usual answer: **all non-ASCII is refused** on trusted strings (`tx/src/wire.rs`, `pqsigner-erc7730/src/ir.rs`), so confusables cannot reach the display | Intra-ASCII lookalikes remain, and live in DB curation rather than rendering |

**Ownership rule:** a new public wallet attack becomes a row here within days,
with an explicit "missing piece" cell. A row whose missing piece is empty must
name the test that closes it.

### 11.5 Maintenance cadence (added 2026-07-31)

A threat model that ages silently is the most dangerous kind — this document
carried a defence in §7.13 for two months after it was descoped (the HID token
bucket; corrected 2026-07-31). To make that harder:

1. **Re-walk §7 on each minor firmware release**, and whenever an attack row in
   §11.4 changes status.
2. **Every mitigation cell must be falsifiable from the repo.** If a cell names
   a mechanism, `grep` must find it. The token-bucket row failed exactly this
   test and nobody ran it.
3. **An EMB3D property→threat crosswalk** (MITRE EMB3D v2.0.2) is a useful
   external cross-check and is worth producing once; TID-level numbers should be
   pinned to a stated EMB3D version, because they move between revisions.
4. **Feed post-launch detections back in**, upgrading theoretical leaves to
   evidenced ones rather than leaving them at "designed against".

## 12. Roadmap to Production Posture

In approximate phasing — the source of truth is the `EthereumPhone/PQ1` issue tracker (labels `source:work-todo` / `source:production-todo`), this is the threat-model lens on the same work.

1. **Phase 0 — Device root-key architecture (work-todo #24).** Closes the OPTIGA-PBS-firmware-hash brick (§7.7 / §9.5-related). Lands `hw/otp.rs` master + `hw/secret_keys.rs` HKDF subkeys + OPTIGA `setup_pbs_no_handshake` rewrite + `hw/huk.rs` re-root. **Landed** (Tier 1 SAES-CMAC(DHUK)).
2. **Phase 1 — Stage 2 brownout foundation (work-todo #21).** BOR/IWDG/ECC/PVD/TAMP/CSS at production defaults. Closes Masaryk-class glitch attacks (§7.9). Tracked.
3. **Phase 2 — SCA mandatory minimums (work-todo #18 P0).** OptRand + double-compute + FihInt + PIN-lockout fail-in. Closes §7.10 and §7.4. Largely landed; FihInt complement-storage pass in progress.
4. **Phase 3 — USB hardening (work-todo #19).** FI-resistant min + bounded reassembly + DWC2 errata workarounds. Closes §7.13.
5. **Phase 4 — Provisioning (work-todo #20 + #36).** Factory burns the per-device OTP transport master, installs SE-internal state on derived transport credentials, and ships at RDP-0 (user-verifiable before first power); on first field boot secure-app early boot self-locks to RDP-2, writes the BHK, rotates SE050 to BHK-rooted finals, and rotates OPTIGA to a DHUK + persisted-salt final PBS. Binding record via #22. Closes §7.11 + §9.2 only after the open protocol/silicon gates close.
6. **Phase 5 — Supply-chain attestation (work-todo #22).** SLH-DSA binding manifest + boot-time triple-UID + transparency log + WebUSB ceremony. Closes §9.4 + tightens §7.11.
7. **Phase 6 — ML-KEM-1024 inner wrap. DESCOPED 2026-07-07** (owner decision): §9.1 residual ACCEPTED instead of closed — Claim 7 stays conditional on the Grover-2⁶⁴/physical-tap bound and on per-device key rotation (Phase 4). Prototype retained feature-gated.
8. **Phase 7 — MPU privilege banking + vendor-pk-hash OTP lock + ITAMP9 → wipe + fuzz corpus.** Closes §9.5, §9.8, §9.9 and the listed empirical-test gaps.

Production-ship is gated on Phases 0–5 (Phase 6 descoped 2026-07-07; its acceptance leans on Phase 4's rotation ceremony). Phase 7 is a hardening pass that does not block first shipment but is required before public bug-bounty announcement.

## 13. Glossary and Cross-References

- **BHK** — Boot Hardware Key. 32 B of TRNG loaded into TAMP backup registers at boot, SAES-only after lock. STM32U585 hardware feature. "HDP-protected flash" storage is Trezor's pattern and a *deferred* PQSigner layer, not current: the ship profile sets `HDP1EN = HDP2EN = 0` and nothing in `secure/src` engages HDP, so the `bhk`-feature BHK sits in ordinary bank-1 flash page 126, DHUK-wrapped (tracked as the deferred HDP1 item, `EthereumPhone/PQ1` issue #39).
- **CMSE** — Cortex-M Security Extensions. ARMv8-M's secure-gateway / `cmse-nonsecure-entry` veneer mechanism.
- **DHUK** — Device Hardware Unique Key. Factory-fused 256-bit per-chip key in ST silicon. SAES-only access; at RDP0 is an ST-substituted constant shared across bench boards; per-die uniqueness only kicks in at RDP ≥ 1.
- **GTZC** — Global TrustZone Controller. Per-peripheral S/NS attribution on STM32U5.
- **HSM** — Hardware Security Module. Off-device vendor signing key custody.
- **LUC** — Lifetime Usage Counter. OPTIGA Trust M E120 silicon-monotonic counter, bound to F1D0 AuthRef's Execute access.
- **NSC** — Non-Secure Callable. The narrow gateway region between TrustZone-S and TrustZone-NS code.
- **PBS** — Platform Binding Secret for OPTIGA Shielded Connection. Current
  dev/legacy code derives a reproducible base value via SAES-CMAC(DHUK); the
  target product ships a factory transport PBS and performs a TRNG-salted final
  rotation after first-field RDP2. That flow and the E140 ordering remain OPEN.
- **RDP** — Readout Protection. STM32 levels 0/1/2 — 2 is irreversible and disables debug.
- **SAES** — Secure AES. STM32U585 AES peripheral with hardware-key selectors (`Software`, `DHUK`, `BHK`, `DHUK^BHK`); keys never appear as bus-visible bytes.
- **SAU** — Security Attribution Unit. ARMv8-M memory-attribution to S/NS/NSC at region granularity.
- **SCP03** — GlobalPlatform Secure Channel Protocol 03. AES-CMAC + AES-CBC channel used by SE050.

## 14. One-line Summary

**No shipping claim is currently made: firmware rollback, OPTIGA shipping-state closure, and the named production gates remain open. Once those are closed, the intended composition requires an adversary to defeat both silicon PIN gates plus the immutable firmware-integrity chain before the three PIN-attempt mechanisms or the 120-second inactivity timeout erase the usable secret state, without triggering a visible measured-boot mismatch on the trusted NV3007 LCD.**

If any one of those three barriers holds, funds stay.
