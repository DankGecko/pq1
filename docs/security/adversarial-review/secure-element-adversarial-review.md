# Secure-element (OPTIGA + SE050) adversarial-review playbook

**Purpose.** A reusable recipe + copy-paste **master prompt** for running an adversarial code-review pass over PQSigner's dual secure-element stack — the OPTIGA Trust M V3 + SE050 drivers, provisioning, and PIN-attempt enforcement. Three invariants converge here:

> **#1 Dual-chip seed split** — BIP-39 entropy is XOR-split (`half_O` on OPTIGA, `half_E` on SE050); neither chip alone reveals a bit. **#2 Hardware PIN gating** — every ordinary PIN attempt is consumed by MCU page 124, OPTIGA F1D0/E120, and the SE050 UserID; boot can perform only the directional readable-counter check `E120_used > page124_used`, while SE050 independently enforces max-10 lockout and reports blocked auth to the wipe path. **#3 E2E encrypted SE tunnels** — OPTIGA Shielded Connection (TLS-PRF + AES-128-CCM-8), SE050 SCP03 (level 0x33); no plaintext secret on I2C.

**How this differs from the bench red-team.** [`docs/security/red-teaming.md`](../red-teaming.md) §5.1–5.6 (SCP03/Shielded/lockstep/lockdown, all silicon) and §4.2 (XOR split) enumerate the *bench pass-fail bars* — logic-analyzer bus captures, desolder rigs, PUT-KEY ceremonies. **This playbook is the code-review counterpart**: it walks the *driver source* against invariants #1/#2/#3, hunting a plaintext-on-wire feature downgrade, a PIN-counter desync the reconcile logic misses, an advertised-vs-actual gap, or a secret OID readable without auth. Same discipline as the [FV playbook](../../verification/fv-adversarial-review-playbook.md); cross-link red-teaming.md as the bench counterpart, do not re-run its checks.

> **Corrected facts (carry these, not folklore).** The research prompts that seeded this playbook carried errors the source corrected — the playbook uses the corrections: **(a)** the master secret is OID **`0xF1D2`** (`OID_MASTER_SECRET`); `0xF1D4` is the **bootstrap VK**, not the master. **(b)** The factory-burned per-device OTP master derives the initial OPTIGA PBS and SE050 transport credentials. The candidate first-field flow replaces them after RDP-2: OPTIGA moves to DHUK plus a page-127-persisted TRNG salt, while SE050 moves to BHK-rooted finals. Bank-1 page 126 (`0x0C0F_C000`) is exclusively the wrapped **SE050 BHK**; page 127 owns the first-boot journal and non-secret salt. Handoff/recovery, exact E140 ordering, silicon evidence, and production approval remain OPEN. **(c)** The reconcile tamper condition is `se_count > mcu` (**not** `!=`) — MCU-leads is benign (power-cut window). **(d)** PIN attempts are three-way, but boot reconciliation is not: the SE050 attempt-attribute read returns `SW=0x6986`, so boot uses the directional MCU-page124/OPTIGA-E120 pair and SE050 retains its independent lockout/status path. **(e)** OPTIGA secret OIDs are provisioned Read = `Auto(F1D0)` **only** (`optiga/mod.rs:2093-2096` — the "Auto AND Conf" claim was a call-site-vs-builder false closure; candidate, pre-adjudication). **(f)** The OPTIGA shield handshake has **no host nonce** (keys = `PRF(PBS, random_S)`) — a recorded session replays; SCP03 (SE050) has a host challenge and does not. SE050 error SWs are unauthenticated by spec (GP Amd D §6.2.5 bare 2-byte responses, any value accepted incl. `0x9000`); OPTIGA statuses are mapped globally (`0x0E`→`PinLocked` for any command, incl. the plaintext `open_application` window). Neither channel's error verdict may drive an irreversible action without state corroboration.

> **Honesty note + ship-blocker framing.** Known S-1/S-2/S-3 items need not be
> duplicate-filed as new discoveries, but their absence remains a ship blocker.
> Reviewers must report any false closure/authority claim or bypass of the
> current quarantine, and cross-link the owning STATUS/production TODO.

## Part A — The secure-element failure catalog (SE1–SE9)

| # | Failure mode | What it looks like | Status (this tree) | Detection | Auto? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SE1 | **Plaintext secret on I2C** | a feature downgrade routes a secret/challenge through the plaintext branch | **DEFENDED (by fence).** `optiga-no-shield` (half_O + PIN HMAC challenge in clear) and factory-key SCP03 (`half_E` decryptable from on-wire challenges via published AN12436 keys) are real plaintext paths, closed only by `compile_error!` fences (`nsc/mod.rs`: HIGH-1 SE-tunnel `:470-491`, MEDIUM-1 `optiga-no-shield` `:501-517`). `GetRandom` must traverse the shield or fail closed (`optiga/mod.rs:239-254`, no silent downgrade) | **Verify the fence trigger covers every shipping config** (see SE8); `scp03_logic.rs` anti-factory-key guard; bus-capture is red-teaming.md §5.1 (silicon) | ✅ fence + host guard / silicon bench |
| SE2 | **Full-entropy concentration** | the full seed sits in one place long enough to scrape | **DEFENDED (transient, zeroized).** Neither chip ever holds both halves; the full seed is reconstructed **only in MCU secure SRAM** at `unlock` (`dual_se.rs:430` `xor_32`), immediately zeroized with `fi::zeroize_barrier()` between steps (`:447-461`). **Residual (disclosed)**: this is the one window invariant #1's split collapses — a RAM-scrape / cold-boot / FI-during-unlock target (HARDENING.md §13 calls the SRAM window the biggest remaining surface) | FI sweep of the unlock window; see [SCA/FI playbook](./sca-fi-adversarial-review.md) for the zeroize-audit + `zeroize_barrier` review | ⚠ partial (zeroize-audit) |
| SE3 | **PIN-counter desync undetected** | an attacker rolls back a readable counter without tripping tamper | **DEFENDED in source within the documented direction; reboot-silicon receipt OPEN.** `reconcile_pin_attempts` fires on `E120_used > page124_used`; MCU-leads is the conservatively charged cut/transport state. The SE050 leg returns `None` under the production policy (`0x6986`), so it contributes independent attempt enforcement/lockout but no boot comparison. | `make pin-gate-hw-counter-e2e` proves three-way attempt consumption and in-run desync recovery; `pin-gate-wipe-e2e` proves 10-wrong → wipe. Neither invokes reboot reconciliation. Add a reboot-based silicon test for E120-leading wipe and benign MCU-leading retention. | ✅ attempt/wipe HW e2e / ⚠ boot edge open |
| SE4 | **Advertised ≠ actual lockstep** | a future doc reintroduces three-way boot-reconciliation language | **OWNER CLAIM CORRECTED; KEEP AS REGRESSION LENS.** `CLAUDE.md` now distinguishes three-way per-attempt consumption from the directional page124/E120 boot check. The SE050 attempt-attribute read remains policy-denied; making it readable would require a separately reviewed policy/backend and silicon decision. | Diff active owner docs against `reconcile_pin_attempts` and `pin_attribute_read_refused_on_user_userid`; any future three-way boot claim reopens SE4 | ✅ documentation correction / regression review |
| SE5 | **Shielded / SCP03 downgrade & replay** | a forced re-handshake drops to plaintext, or a captured transcript replays | **PARTIAL — CANDIDATE BREAK (2026-07-17, pre-adjudication).** The cited defenses are all *intra*-session and hold as read: OPTIGA lower-seq refused (`shield.rs:327-329`), nonce-wrap renegotiate at `enc_seq>=0xFFFF_FFF0` (`shield.rs:246-249`), record-type in AAD (`shield.rs:209-221`); SCP03 monotonic counter + mandatory 0x33 unwrap, and SCP03's host-challenge handshake is **not** replayable. **But the OPTIGA PRL handshake carries no host nonce** (`shield.rs:388` — MasterHello is two constant bytes; session keys = `PRF(PBS, "Platform Binding", random_S)`, `shield.rs:182-194`) and post-handshake `dec_seq = 0` accepts any `seq >= dec_seq` (`shield.rs:327,560-561`), so an entire *recorded* session replays end-to-end as a new session with identical keys — contradicting threat-model.md:233/255 ("freshness nonce on each session", "no replay window") and the audit's "replaced chip … cannot produce a valid SlaveFinished" (replay needs no forgery). Consequences sketched: replayed E120 read forging `E120 > page124` → tamper-wipe; replayed wipe-ACKs (no verify-after-write exists); optiga-only builds: replayed unlock = PIN bypass. Protocol-inherent to Infineon PRL; fixes are procedural (persisted `random_S` watermark, fresh GetRandom round-trip before trusting destructive verdicts, post-wipe readback). Also confirmed live: `send_command` falls back to **plaintext** whenever `shield.active == false` (`optiga/apdu.rs:432-434`), and `unwrap_response` kills the session on an *unauthenticated* `seq >= 0xFFFF_FFF0` checked **before** the CCM tag (`shield.rs:330-334`) — an interposer can force the plaintext branch mid-flow. SCP03 leg: no downgrade found; self-heal gap is SE13. | Rainbow `fault_sweep_scp03.py`; bench: record+replay a full session against the stock firmware; check whether `contracts/verification/proverif/optiga_shield_handshake.pv` models host freshness (if it claims replay resistance, it contradicts this row) | ⚠ partial (source-confirmed mechanics; bench replay PoC owed) |
| SE6 | **OID read without auth** | a secret OID readable with `require_shielded=false` | **CANDIDATE FALSE CLOSURE (2026-07-17, pre-adjudication).** The builder supports Read = `Auto(0xF1D0) AND Conf(0xE140)` (`apdu.rs:975-976`), but **every production call site passes `false`**: `store_objects` provisions F1D1/F1D2/F1D3/F1D4 with Read = `Auto(F1D0)` alone (`optiga/mod.rs:2093-2096`, duress twins `:2233-2236`) — wire AC is `D1 03 23 F1 D0`, not the claimed AND form. `build_metadata_protected(_, true)` occurs only in a host test (`optiga_under_test/pure_tests.rs:228`). This row's own detection recipe ("grep for any read of F1D1/F1D2 with `require_shielded=false`") fires today; the AC-builder tests asserted builder output, never the call-site argument. The stale `mod.rs:2062-2064` comment ("while shielded is disabled we drop the Conf(E140) arm") describes a conditional the code does not have. Chip-side consequence: after any successful F1D0 HMAC verify the secret OIDs are plaintext-readable in that session — no PBS/shield needed — and `verify_and_lock` ratchets the weak AC irreversibly under `optiga-lock-operational`. E120 and F1E1 are `Read = Always` and non-secret; only E120 is lockout authority in production. Docs claiming the AND form (docs/archive/work-todo-retired-2026-07-19.md:751, F-trezor comparison :492) are wrong as read. **Lesson: catalog detection recipes must exercise call sites, not just builders.** | Grep for `provision_user_oid(` call-site arguments; e2e metadata readback asserting the *installed* AC | ❌ found-this-surface (candidate) |
| SE7 | **Brick / extraction on fw-update** | a fw-update writes the page holding a re-derivation root and bricks the wallet or exposes a secret | **DEFENDED (redirected).** OPTIGA PBS has no flash copy: the factory transport PBS is OTP-master-derived and the candidate final PBS derives from DHUK plus the page-127 salt. **The secret-bearing class lives on the SE050 axis**: the wrapped BHK is on bank-1 page 126 (`hw/bhk.rs:72`), and `hw/bhk.rs:40` mandates "the firmware-update path MUST NOT touch page 126" | Audit the fw-update staging/erase range against the single-owner BHK page, preserve page 127's journal ownership, and keep persistent failure-state writes absent; the historical collision report is `docs/security/vulns/VULN-page126-bhk-fwfail-collision-brick.md` | ⚠ partial (range audit) |
| SE8 | **Ship-blocker fence gap** | a shipping config that ships a blocker open | The irreversible SE closures remain OPEN. During the rollback quarantine, all production/factory STM32 shapes are rejected; bench builds require the explicit production-forbidden `legacy-fw-rollback-unsafe` feature. Production already requires `optiga-hw-counter`; E120 is lockout authority. F1E1 remains a provisioning/reset sentinel whose final lifecycle or replacement is separately tracked, not a missing one-line production fence. | Negative production/factory compilation tests plus the future reviewed SE ceremony | 🚫 shipping blocked |
| SE9 | **A half crosses chips** | a provisioning/debug path ships one chip's half to the other | **NOT OBSERVED.** Each half is read/decrypted independently (`dual_se.rs:388-425`) and only XORed locally in MCU SRAM | Confirm no debug/prov path (`factory_provisioning.rs`, the `dual-se-*-e2e` harnesses) transmits a half to the opposite chip | ❌ adversary (grep + review) |
| SE10 | **Unauthenticated error/status response → destructive verdict** | a spec-mandated *unauthenticated* error response (or a globally-mapped status) is accepted by the channel layer and mapped by upper layers to wipe / PIN-burn / "object gone" | **CANDIDATE (2026-07-17, pre-adjudication; 4/5 SE050 + 3/5 OPTIGA reviewer convergence).** SE050: GP Amd D §6.2.5 exempts error SWs from R-MAC, so `unwrap_response` passes **any** bare 2-byte SW with no authentication (`scp03.rs:605-627`) — including bare `0x9000`, provably illegal at level 0x33 per the file's own doc. Chain: bare `0x6986` → `AuthMethodBlocked` (`apdu.rs:749,826-828`) → `PinLocked` (`se050/mod.rs:2745-2751`) → **unconditional** `trigger_lockout_wipe` (`cmd_request_unlock.rs:126-131`): one forged frame wipes both SEs. Bare `0x6985` forges `PinIncorrect` (burns pre-committed page-124, `nsc/mod.rs:1097`) and fake "object gone" in `check_exists` (`apdu.rs:454`). OPTIGA: `parse_response` maps `0x0E` → `PinLocked` for **any** command (`optiga/apdu.rs:390-397`), including the plaintext pre-shield `open_application` window (`:443-452`) and every post-verify `?` propagation; `0x07` → `PinIncorrect` globally likewise. The genuine lockout signals travel the same unauthenticated/mis-mapped path, so wire-level distinction is impossible — corroboration must come from state (re-handshake + repeat probe, counter floors) before any irreversible action. | Bus-injection PoC on the stress harness (FaultyCat-class MITM); one-line gate rejecting bare SW ∈ {0x9000, 0x62xx, 0x63xx} (SE050); per-command-site status scoping (OPTIGA) | ❌ found-this-surface (candidate) |
| SE11 | **Inconclusive probe coerced to a destructive/lifecycle verdict** | an existence/state probe that cannot say "I don't know" answers "no"/"gone"/"unprovisioned" on transport error, and the next step is irreversible | **CANDIDATE (2026-07-17, pre-adjudication).** The D1 fix ("inconclusive ≠ absent") was applied to the rotation ceremonies but not the wipe/provisioning paths. SE050: post-wipe `check_exists(...).unwrap_or(false)` counts glitches as "gone" (`se050/mod.rs:2296,2312-2314,2322-2324`); `admin_exists()` (`:566-574`) gates the page-125 wipe-flag erase *before* the `wipe_result` check (`:3092-3108`); admin-PIN derivation failure returns `Ok(())` before the flag is armed (`:3068-3081`); the gateway discards the wipe error and resets page-124 + prints "WALLET WIPED" unconditionally (`cmd_request_unlock.rs:161-169`). OPTIGA: `check_provisioned` returns `false` on any *cleanly-framed* `Status(_)`/empty read — and that read is **plaintext at cold boot** (`optiga/mod.rs:852-905`, init RST-kills the PRL first), so one injected frame routes a provisioned wallet to the re-provisioning wizard; the "fail-SAFE on wedge" epilogue (`:895-905`) covers only transport-class errors. E120 gate treats read failure as `NotProvisioned` (`:2290-2293`); `pin_attempt_count` `None` → reconcile silently skips (log is `debug-log`-gated, `nsc/mod.rs:1244`); legacy soft-counter readback `None` → `PinLocked` (`:2355`, fenced out of production). Wipe-list completeness gaps in the same class: SE050 `DATA_AND_CANARY_OBJS` omits all four `DURESS_*` OIDs (`se050/mod.rs:2146-2156` vs doc claims at `:69-71,1979-1983`); OPTIGA has **no post-wipe readback at all** and duress blanks are `let _ =` ×5 (`optiga/mod.rs:2689-2697`) — note F1DA holds the decoy master *unsplit* (`dual_se.rs:219`), so its survival is an offline decoy-seed oracle. | Grep for `unwrap_or(false)` / `let _ =` on destructive paths; bench: fault each probe during a wipe and watch the verdict | ❌ found-this-surface (candidate) |
| SE12 | **Secret residue asymmetry (command-side hardened, response/error paths not)** | the buffers the LCR-F4/MEDIUM-1 work zeroized were the command/session ones; decrypted-response and error-path locals keep plaintext | **CANDIDATE (2026-07-17, pre-adjudication; 3/5 + 4/5 convergence).** SE050: `send_apdu`'s `unwrapped[1024]` (`apdu.rs:376`), `verify_session`'s PIN-bearing `inner[64]` (`:782-796`), `read_authed`'s `resp` (`:863`), error-path `entropy` locals (`se050/mod.rs:2703-2707`). OPTIGA: `get_data_object`'s `resp[512]` (`apdu.rs:756`), the 768-byte `ApduBuf` with no `Drop` (holds the PIN-HMAC — an **offline dictionary oracle for the 8-digit PIN** — plus provisioning-time `pin_secret`/`half_O`/master), `authenticate_and_read` error arms after a successful verify (`optiga/mod.rs:2489-2516`). Consumers: `dual_se.rs` `provision` (`:181-189`) and `unlock` (`:389-426`) error arms leave both halves/masters live; zeroize-the-**copy** bugs (`optiga/mod.rs:2026-2031`, `dual_se.rs:223-238`) leave the original binding live; `user_factory_reset` skips `zeroize_session` (`se050/mod.rs:826-868`). | Zeroize-audit sweep extended to response/error paths; `Zeroizing`/Drop on `ApduBuf`; host test scraping stack frames after a forced error | ❌ found-this-surface (candidate) |
| SE13 | **Session-recovery wired into only some failure arms → wedge burns page-124 to self-wipe** | the self-heal (`reinit`/drop-`ready`-and-`active` + bounded retry) exists in some paths but not the PIN-hot ones; each wedged attempt keeps the pre-committed MCU bump | **CANDIDATE (2026-07-17, pre-adjudication; 4/5 convergence).** OPTIGA: self-heal exists in `random()` (`optiga/mod.rs:255-272`), `check_provisioned` (`:884-892`), `factory_reset` (`:2587-2591`) — but **not** in `authenticate_and_read` (`:2267-2273`), so the silicon-observed `08 40` PRL-alert wedge makes every retry fail `InternalError` while page-124 (pre-committed, `nsc/mod.rs:1097-1112`) ratchets to MAX → wipe with **zero wrong-PIN events**; chip counters never move, so the desync is the reconcile-tolerated direction. SE050 twin: `reinit()` only on failed-*verify* arms; a mid-`read_authed` or failed `create_session` transport fault leaves the A3 session-pending wedge → every later attempt `0x6982` → `InternalError` until power cycle. Related FI-hardening asymmetry: the E120 `curr >= limit` wipe gate is a single unhardened read ("validated by inspection", `optiga/mod.rs:2297-2314`) while the MCU-side page-124 read is double-read + sentinel-gated. | Bench: wedge the PRL once, retry unlock 10×, observe self-wipe; grep for error arms missing the state-drop | ❌ found-this-surface (candidate) |
| SE14 | **Compound/legacy wire shapes bypass the attempt economy** | a different-but-chip-accepted command shape authorizes without advancing the silicon counter | **CANDIDATE (2026-07-17, pre-adjudication; silicon saturation case owed).** The tree's own silicon note (`optiga/mod.rs:2365-2378`) records that the 64-byte compound `hmac_verify` shape (Infineon example shape, accepted by the chip in all builds, `apdu.rs:847-868`) authorizes F1D0 for reads **without advancing E120** — a direct-chip attacker (desolder, in the S-1 threat model) needs no MCU cooperation to brute-force the PIN at KDF speed. Unverified: whether verifies are refused once `E120.current >= limit` (decides "unbounded" vs "32× amplification"). Not S-1: requires no F1D0 rewrite, no PBS, no MCU. Claims at stake: threat-model §S3 "10 attempts → wipe", the lockstep audit's strictest-of-three cap. | Silicon matrix: compound shape × {success, failure, at/above threshold} → E120 increment + refusal behavior; if confirmed free, downgrade the brute-force claims to MCU-mediated attempts and lean on the SE6 Conf(E140) fix as compensating control | ⚠ silicon-owed |

**Read this catalog as a review map, not a shipping verdict.** SE8 and the
factory half remain open blockers even when already tracked.

---

## Part B — The existing defenses (Layer 1)

1. **Compile-time ship-blocker fences.** The `compile_error!` wall in `nsc/mod.rs` (S-1/S-2/S-3 OPTIGA, HIGH-1/MEDIUM-1 SE tunnels, Tier-1 KDF REQUIRE, tamp/tamp-wipe/tzic-wipe, consumption-mask, the leaky-feature denylist `:114-133`). These *prevent shipping unhardened* but do not close the bench/factory half (SE8).
2. **HW PIN-attempt e2e (silicon).** `make pin-gate-hw-counter-e2e` proves three-way attempt consumption, in-run desynchronization recovery, and simulated cache resynchronization; it does not reboot or exercise the directional boot check. `pin-gate-wipe-e2e` proves 10-wrong → factory-reset both SEs + page-124 erase. `optiga-hw-counter-e2e` provisions E120 LUC and drives cycles (PASSED 2026-04-22). A separate cold-reboot silicon receipt for E120-leading wipe and MCU-leading retention remains OPEN.
3. **SE050 stress catalog (silicon).** `make se050-stress` / `-destructive` — the S-5/S-6 verifiers and the source of the silicon findings (`docs/secure-elements/se050-silicon-findings.md`); `se050-admin-extract-attempt-e2e` (S-6), `dual-se-admin-wipe-e2e`, `dual-se-bhk-e2e`.
4. **Host logic tests.** `scp03_logic.rs` (SCP03 KDF + GP PUT-KEY vectors + anti-factory-key guard), `optiga_under_test/pure_tests.rs`, `se050_under_test/pure_tests.rs`, `nsc_core_under_test/pure_tests.rs` (verifies the `compile_error!` fences exist). AC-builder tests for the Read = `Auto AND Conf` gate (SE6).
5. **FI + protocol backstops.** Rainbow `fault_sweep_{scp03,optiga_lock,pin}.py`; the ProVerif model `contracts/verification/proverif/optiga_shield_handshake.pv`. See the [SCA/FI playbook](./sca-fi-adversarial-review.md) for the unlock-window FI review.

## Part C — THE MASTER PROMPT

```
ROLE: You are an adversarial reviewer of PQSigner_OS's dual secure-element stack. Your
job is to BREAK invariants #1 (XOR seed split), #2 (three-way per-attempt PIN
enforcement plus the directional page124/E120 boot check),
and #3 (no plaintext secret on I2C), NOT to confirm them. Default to "a secret leaks or
a counter desyncs until I prove it can't." A passing HW e2e and a confident invariant in
CLAUDE.md are CONSISTENCY signals — attack whether all three attempt paths run,
whether the boot predicate exceeds its documented direction, and whether the
plaintext-downgrade fences cover every shipping config.

CORRECTED FACTS (use these, not the folklore): master OID = 0xF1D2 (F1D4 = bootstrap VK);
factory transport PBS/SCP03/admin derive from the factory-burned OTP master; the
candidate final OPTIGA PBS derives from DHUK plus the page-127-persisted TRNG salt
and has no secret flash copy (page 126 = wrapped SE050 BHK only — the brick concern
is the BHK, not the PBS); reconcile fires on E120_used > page124_used
(NOT !=); SE050's 0x6986 attempt-attribute denial excludes it from boot reconciliation,
not from per-attempt consumption or its independent max-10 lockout.

TARGET (read first, in this order):
  - docs/security/adversarial-review/secure-element-adversarial-review.md §A — SE1–SE9.
  - secure/src/dual_se.rs — XOR split, unlock/reconstruction window, reconcile inputs.
  - secure/src/nsc/mod.rs:1053-1108 (reconcile predicate) + :281-517 (ship-blocker fences).
  - secure/src/optiga/{mod,shield,apdu}.rs — Shielded Connection, AC metadata builders, OIDs.
  - secure/src/se050/{mod,scp03,apdu}.rs — SCP03 level, UserID PIN, admin path.
  - Cross-check: docs/STATUS.md §A (ship-gate + evidence) + docs/security/threat-model.md
    §5 (the falsifiable claims). Cross-link known S-1/S-2/S-3 ownership rather
    than duplicate-filing, but report any false closure, authority, or bypass.
SCOPE THIS RUN: {{e.g. "the reconcile predicate + the None-leg divergence path" | "every
  plaintext-downgrade fence vs the shipping feature matrix" | "the unlock reconstruction
  window" | "the shielded/SCP03 re-handshake fallback"}}.

ATTACK PROTOCOL — walk EVERY SE1–SE14 mode against each surface in scope:
  SE1 plaintext-on-I2C · SE2 full-entropy concentration · SE3 PIN-counter desync ·
  SE4 advertised≠actual lockstep · SE5 shielded/SCP03 downgrade+replay (incl.
  whole-recorded-session replay — check handshake host freshness, not just
  intra-session seq) · SE6 OID read without auth (check call sites, not just
  builders) · SE7 brick/extraction on fw-update · SE8 ship-blocker fence gap ·
  SE9 a half crosses chips · SE10 unauthenticated error/status → destructive
  verdict · SE11 inconclusive probe coerced to a destructive verdict ·
  SE12 secret residue on response/error paths · SE13 recovery-gap wedge →
  self-wipe · SE14 compound/legacy wire shapes bypassing the attempt economy.

For each candidate finding you MUST produce a FALSIFIABLE PoC, one of:
  - a shipping feature-combo that trips a plaintext path without hitting a compile_error!;
  - a counter-desync sequence the reconcile predicate classifies benign (e.g. force one
    leg to None, then drift the other);
  - a code path reading F1D1/F1D2 with require_shielded=false;
  - a fw-update erase range that touches the BHK page (bank-1 0x0C0F_C000);
  - a diff between an invariant's TEXT and what the driver actually enforces (SE4-shaped).
  No PoC ⇒ list under "suspicions, unverified".

RULES:
  - Verify against the CURRENT tree; distinguish a silicon-validated claim from a host-only
    one (bus-capture / desolder are red-teaming.md bench items — cite, don't re-run).
  - Known S-1/S-2/S-3 blockers remain blockers. Avoid duplicate catalogue
    entries, but report false closure/authority and every new bypass.
  - For each candidate: SE-mode, file:line, PoC, provisional severity, stable
    candidate ID, and proposed fix (flag
    if it would break a fence, regress an e2e, or weaken an AC).
    Do not assign a finding disposition.

OUTPUT — return an external candidate packet to the coordinator. Do not modify
the repository, write a canonical findings report, or update catalogue/status
fields. Include every candidate and the honest residual. The coordinator freezes
the raw packet and gives the complete union to the exact Partner-A/Partner-B
pair; only their symmetric cross-adjudication may assign dispositions. An
authorized maintainer records the adjudicated result afterward.

MANDATORY HONEST RESIDUAL (the run is INVALID without it):
  1. "What I tried to break and COULDN'T" — per surface.
  2. "What I did NOT look at" — drivers/paths not walked, SE-modes not exhausted, whether
     you reasoned about silicon behavior you did not run.
  3. "PROVENANCE — did this pass RUN any e2e / stress / FI sweep, or read source only?"
  Never imply "the rest is fine."

**Running it as a swarm.** Use ≥3 independent discovery reviewers per scope
across two model backends. Quorum only corroborates/prioritizes discovery; it
does not set a disposition, and sub-quorum variants remain in the packet. Give
every candidate and origin variant to the exact Partner-A/Partner-B pair in
[`../../planning-and-review-workflow.md`](../../planning-and-review-workflow.md);
only their symmetric cross-adjudication may disposition it, with disagreement
preserved.

## Part D — Cadence + honest boundary

- **Per-PR touching `optiga/`, `se050/`, `dual_se.rs`, or the reconcile/fence code:** the Layer-1 host logic tests + a scoped Part-C pass; a change to the reconcile predicate or a fence re-runs `pin-gate-hw-counter-e2e` on silicon.
- **Per-invariant-text edit (CLAUDE.md #1/#2/#3):** re-check the SE4 claim-vs-code map — does the driver still enforce what the text now says?
- **Pre-ship (design-lock):** the deferred S-1/S-2/S-3 factory ceremony + the bench red-team (red-teaming.md §5) — the once-only irreversible work.
- **The one-line gut check:** *if one chip is fully compromised, the bus is tapped, or a readable counter is rolled back — does every attempt still consume the documented gates, and does boot enforce exactly the documented directional check?* Any return of "three-way boot reconciliation" language is claim drift.

**The boundary, stated on purpose.** This playbook can tell you whether the *driver source* enforces invariants #1/#2/#3 as written, and whether the claim drifts again (SE4) or rests on a fence (SE1/SE8). It **cannot** tell you the shield actually carries no plaintext on a logic-analyzer (red-teaming.md §5.1), that the LcsO ratchet was burned on a sacrificial part (the deferred S-1 factory work), or that a chip-firmware rev won't change the SE050 counter behavior. Those are the bench's + the factory ceremony's job.
