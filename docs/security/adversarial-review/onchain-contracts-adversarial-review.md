# On-chain Solidity contracts adversarial-review playbook

**Purpose.** A reusable recipe + copy-paste **master prompt** for an adversarial code-review pass over PQSigner's on-chain Solidity — `PQSmartWallet.sol`, `PQSmartWalletFactory.sol`, `PQMultiOwnable.sol`, and `verifiers/SPHINCsC10Asm.sol`. This is a **Solidity code review distinct from the Lean `theft_free` proof**: the FV tree proves *no unauthorized fund movement given a correct signed digest*; this playbook hunts the Solidity-level failure classes that live *outside* that scope.

> **The honest headline: this surface is heavily covered.** Almost every Solidity failure class is already closed by the contract code (with a file:line), the Lean tree (`theft_free` + `Wallet/*.lean`), the codehash-freeze / bytecode-repro tests, or the Kontrol/Halmos symbolic proofs. So this playbook's job is **mostly to state what is already covered and cross-link it** — and to keep a bright light on the *three* items covered by **neither** forge nor FV.

**How this differs from the FV playbook + the bench red-team.** The [FV adversarial-review playbook](../../verification/fv-adversarial-review-playbook.md) attacks the *Lean proofs* for vacuity (is `theft_free` hollow?). **This playbook attacks the Solidity as code** — reentrancy, storage collision, dispatch confusion, upgrade paths — the EVM-level behaviors a Lean state-transition model doesn't drive concretely. The C10 verifier *math* is out of scope (that is the A3.1 bytecode bridge, FV surface #2). Cross-link the Lean/forge/Kontrol/Halmos gates; do not re-derive them.

> **Honesty note.** Every row's `Status` tags its existing coverage (`theft_free` / Lean / `codehash-freeze` / `forge` / `Kontrol` / `Halmos` / **NONE**). Only the **NONE** rows are live review targets. SOL6 (cross-slot `removeOwnerAtIndex`) is a genuine un-reviewed item promoted to work-todo (likely by-design — confirm in the threat model); SOL2 (EVM reentrancy) is mitigated-but-untested; SOL8 is an operational (not in-contract) assumption.

## Part A — The Solidity failure catalog (SOL1–SOL8)

| # | Failure mode | What it looks like | Status / existing coverage | Live target? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SOL1 | **"Validated X, executed Y" swap** | the executed call differs from the signed one | **DEFENDED.** `sphincsDigest` (`PQSmartWallet.sol:374-391`) folds `sha256(callData)`, `sha256(paymasterAndData)`, all gas fields, `entryPoint`, and `block.chainid` into the signed digest — target/value/data can't be substituted post-validation. Covered: `theft_free`, forge | ❌ closed |
| SOL2 | **EVM-level reentrancy of `execute*WithOffchainCount`** | a malicious `target` re-enters to mint value / replay a credit | **MITIGATED, UNTESTED (the strongest NONE item to probe).** CEI-clean: `_consumeValidatedCredit` (one-shot, EIP-1153 transient) runs *before* the external call (`:247`); `offchainSigCount` already advanced + monotonic; `receive()` state-free. Re-entry can at most consume a co-bundled op's credit → that sibling reverts (liveness loss, not theft). **But FV models the credit as one-shot at the state-transition level only — no concrete EVM reentrancy harness exists** | ⚠ **NONE (mitigated, no concrete test)** |
| SOL3 | **ERC-7201 storage collision** | the namespaced storage aliases ERC-1967 or itself | **DEFENDED.** Slot `keccak256(keccak256(ns)-1)&~0xff` (`PQMultiOwnable.sol:60-63`); mappings, no packed sub-word aliasing. Covered: `StorageSlotParity.t.sol:46/76`, Lean `StorageLayout.lean:79-97` | ❌ closed |
| SOL4 | **Cap off-by-one / bypass** | the monotonic cap is bypassable or miscounts | **DEFENDED.** `>=` pre-bump (validation) vs `>` post-bump (execution) — both correct, sum can't exceed cap (`PQSmartWallet.sol:453/479`, `PQMultiOwnable.sol:228/231`); bump only after C10 verify. No `reset*`/`increaseMax*`/`rotateMasterKeys` anywhere. Covered: Lean `MultiOwnable.lean`, forge cap-exhaust + `PQBootstrapCapEvasion.t.sol`, Kontrol, Halmos | ❌ closed |
| SOL5 | **Type1/Type2 dispatch confusion** | a slot key calls `addOwnerBytes`, or a bootstrap key executes / signs off-chain | **DEFENDED.** Role-split on `ownerIndex` (`:449-482`): Type1 (0) may only `addOwnerBytes`, Type2 (≥1) only execute/remove (`_isSlotAllowedSelector:544`); bootstrap forbidden off-chain (`:630`); H-2 self-call block (`:248,:282`). Covered: forge `test_slotCannotCallAddOwner`/`test_bootstrapCannotCallExecute`, Lean | ❌ closed |
| SOL6 | **Cross-slot `removeOwnerAtIndex` not bound to the signing slot** | a slot key at index *i* removes an unrelated slot *j* | **◑ DOCUMENTED + PINNED 2026-07-02 (availability, by-design; tighten-decision open).** Now covered by `test_sol6_crossSlotRemoveIsAcceptedByDesign` + a `threat-model.md` §8 design note.**Was:** UN-REVIEWED. The H-3 parity check (calldata first-arg == signed `ownerIndex`) is **deliberately skipped for the remove selector** (`:469-474`), so any slot key ≥1 can `removeOwnerAtIndex(j, owner_j)` for any *j*≥1 (`ownerAtIndex(j)` is a public getter). Impact: intra-wallet **availability**, not theft; bootstrap (0) is unremovable + can re-add. **`theft_free` silent** (no funds move); Lean covers index-0 only; no forge/Kontrol/Halmos test exercises cross-slot *authorization*. The code comment suggests it is intended — **confirm the threat model accepts "any slot can prune any slot"** | ⚠ **NONE — promoted to work-todo** |
| SOL7 | **Proxy / ERC-1967 upgrade path** | an upgrade selector or delegatecall lets the impl be swapped | **DEFENDED.** No `delegatecall` in `execute*` (grep empty), no UUPS selector, nothing writes the ERC-1967 impl slot. Covered: Lean `UpgradeSafety.upgrade_path_unreachable:121`, forge `invariant_impl_slot_unchanged:190`. **One-line confirm worth keeping**: the proxy IS Solady's ERC-1967 (`LibClone`), so the guarantee rests on the impl exposing no upgrade selector | ❌ closed (confirm no impl upgrade selector) |
| SOL8 | **CREATE2 salt / cross-chain topology** | the same-address-every-chain property breaks, or a squat pre-empts a victim | **DEFENDED (with an operational caveat).** `_salt = sha256(masterPkSeed‖masterPkRoot)` (`Factory.sol:145`, fixed-width packed → no concat-collision); squat defense = bootstrap-key C10 sig over `addSlot0Digest` bound to `chainId` (`:104-112,142`); atomic init. Covered: forge squat/chain tests, Halmos `prove_createAccount_iff`, Kontrol, Lean `Factory.lean`. **Operational caveat (not in-contract)**: address determinism silently depends on identical factory+impl addresses cross-chain — asserted for Base by `DeployedBytecodeReproCheck.t.sol`, not enforceable in-contract | ⚠ operational assumption (not a code bug) |

**Read this catalog as the answer to "is there un-reviewed Solidity that could move funds or brick the wallet?"** The theft classes (SOL1/SOL4/SOL5/SOL7/SOL8) are closed by code + FV + tests. The genuinely un-reviewed residuals are **three, none of them fund-theft**: SOL2 (EVM reentrancy — mitigated by CEI + one-shot transient credit, but no concrete harness), SOL6 (cross-slot remove — availability, likely by-design), and SOL8's cross-chain deployment-topology assumption (operational, not in-contract). Everything else is affirmatively closed with a cited gate.

## Part B — The existing defenses (Layer 1)

1. **Forge suites** (`contracts/smart-wallet/test/`): `PQSmartWallet.t.sol` (functional + audit regressions H-1/2/3, L-1/2), `PQBootstrapCapEvasion.t.sol`, `PQMultiOpBundle.t.sol` (cross-index credit theft), `PQSmartWalletInvariants.t.sol` (stateful invariants), `StorageSlotParity.t.sol`, `PQSmartWalletRealSig.t.sol` (real C10 vectors).
2. **Codehash / bytecode gates**: `PinnedCodehashes.t.sol` + `DeployedBytecodeReproCheck.t.sol` (byte-for-byte repro of deployed Base bytecode) + `PinnedBytecodeImmutableLemma.t.sol` + `LeanSelectorParity.t.sol` + `SPHINCsC10AsmMutantCorpus.t.sol`.
3. **Lean `theft_free` + `Wallet/*.lean`**: `ValidateUserOp`, `Execute`, `CreditLedger`, `MultiOwnable`, `Factory`, `IsValidSignature`, `StorageLayout`, `UpgradeSafety`, `OffchainBinding`, `TxFlow`, `Invariants`. The A3.1 bridge (`Bridge/`) models the Yul verifier control-flow (explicitly *not* gas/revert-data/ABI-decoding).
4. **Kontrol / Halmos symbolic**: pointwise equivalence of `validateUserOp`/`execute*`/`addOwner`/`removeOwner`/`createAccount`/`isValidSignature` vs the Lean models + non-bypass/entrypoint-gating/credit-one-shot.
5. **The un-covered gaps** (the payload): SOL2 (no concrete reentrancy harness), SOL6 (no cross-slot authorization test), SOL8 (the deployment-topology assumption asserted only for Base).

## Part C — THE MASTER PROMPT

```
ROLE: You are an adversarial Solidity reviewer of PQSigner_OS's on-chain contracts. Your job
is to find a Solidity-level failure (reentrancy, storage collision, dispatch confusion, upgrade
path, authorization gap) that the Lean theft_free proof and the codehash-freeze tests do NOT
cover — NOT to re-verify the C10 math (that is the A3.1 bridge, out of scope). Default to "this
is un-reviewed until I confirm a forge/Lean/Kontrol/Halmos/codehash gate covers it." The value
here is the NONE rows: EVM reentrancy (mitigated, untested), cross-slot removeOwnerAtIndex, and
the cross-chain deployment-topology assumption.

TARGET (read first, in this order):
  - docs/security/adversarial-review/onchain-contracts-adversarial-review.md §A — SOL1–SOL8
    (with the existing-coverage tag per row).
  - contracts/smart-wallet/src/{PQSmartWallet,PQMultiOwnable,PQSmartWalletFactory}.sol.
  - contracts/smart-wallet/test/ — confirm which class each test actually covers.
  - contracts/verification/lean/SphincsCVerify/Wallet/*.lean — what theft_free/Lean covers.
SCOPE THIS RUN: {{e.g. "EVM reentrancy of execute*WithOffchainCount (SOL2)" | "cross-slot
  removeOwnerAtIndex authorization (SOL6)" | "the full role-split dispatch" | "verify every
  SOL row's cited gate actually covers what it claims"}}.

ATTACK PROTOCOL — walk EVERY SOL1–SOL8 mode; for each, either produce a PoC OR cite the exact
gate that closes it (and CONFIRM the gate covers the claim — a forge test named for X that
doesn't assert X is a hollow gate, report it):
  SOL1 validated-X-executed-Y · SOL2 EVM reentrancy · SOL3 ERC-7201 collision · SOL4 cap
  off-by-one · SOL5 Type1/Type2 dispatch · SOL6 cross-slot remove · SOL7 proxy/upgrade ·
  SOL8 CREATE2 salt / cross-chain topology.

For each candidate finding you MUST produce a FALSIFIABLE PoC, one of:
  - a forge reentrancy harness where a malicious target re-enters execute* and gains value or
    replays a credit (SOL2);
  - a signed op where slot i removes slot j with no i–j binding (SOL6) + a threat-model quote
    showing it's unexpected;
  - a storage-slot computation that aliases (SOL3) or an upgrade selector that swaps the impl (SOL7);
  - a gate whose name claims coverage its body doesn't provide (a hollow test).
  No PoC ⇒ list under "suspicions, unverified".

RULES:
  - Verify against the CURRENT tree; the C10 verifier math is OUT of scope (A3.1 bridge).
  - Distinguish theft (funds move) from availability (a slot pruned) from operational (a
    deployment assumption) — SOL6/SOL8 are not theft; label severity accordingly.
  - For each finding: SOL-mode, file:line, PoC, disposition, severity, proposed fix (flag if it
    would change a codehash-frozen contract — that breaks the pin and needs a re-freeze).

OUTPUT — file findings so they can be catalogued + worked through (see
docs/security/adversarial-review/findings/README.md):
  Write a dated report to docs/security/adversarial-review/findings/<surface>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md
  from findings/TEMPLATE.md — everything below (findings + the honest residual) goes IN it.
  Report frontmatter `status: open`; EACH finding gets its own `Status:` line (start 🔲 OPEN)
  + a falsifiable PoC. Add one row to the Catalogue table in findings/README.md. As findings
  are worked through, whoever handles each flips its `Status:` (✅ FIXED / ☑️ ACCEPTED /
  🚫 INVALID / ⏸ DEFERRED) + a Resolution (commit+date or why), and sets the report
  `status: resolved` once none remain OPEN. work-todo.md stays the action list; findings/ is
  the review record — cross-link them.

MANDATORY HONEST RESIDUAL (the run is INVALID without it):
  1. "What I tried to break and COULDN'T" — per class, with the covering gate.
  2. "What I did NOT look at" — classes not walked, gates not confirmed to cover their claim.
  3. "PROVENANCE — did this pass RUN forge / kontrol / halmos, or read source + Lean only?"
  Never imply "the rest is fine."
```

**Running it as a swarm.** ≥3 reviewers per scope, cross-vote, two model backends. A productive split: one reviewer writes the SOL2 reentrancy harness, one attacks SOL6 authorization, one audits whether each cited gate actually covers its claim.

---

## Part D — Cadence + honest boundary

- **Per-PR touching a contract:** `forge test` + the codehash-freeze tests (a source change that alters bytecode must re-freeze the pin deliberately) + a scoped Part-C pass. Re-run Kontrol/Halmos if a proven function changed.
- **Per-milestone:** a fresh Part-C pass focused on the three NONE items; land the SOL2 reentrancy harness + a SOL6 authorization test to shrink the un-covered set.
- **The one-line gut check:** *for each Solidity failure class, is there a gate that turns red if it regresses — and does that gate actually assert the property, not just its name?* SOL2/SOL6 currently have no such gate.

**The boundary, stated on purpose.** This playbook can tell you that every fund-theft Solidity class is closed by a cited gate, and it names the three residuals covered by neither forge nor FV (SOL2/SOL6/SOL8). It **cannot** tell you the EVM reentrancy is truly safe without a concrete harness (SOL2), that the cross-slot remove is acceptable without a threat-model decision (SOL6), or that the cross-chain factory+impl addresses match in a future deployment (SOL8 — that is a deployment process, asserted only for Base). Those are the harness's, the threat-model owner's, and the deploy process's job.
