//! CMD_FW_COMMIT — legacy V1 staged-update finalizer (bench only).
//!
//! **Production-blocked:** this handler predates Draft 1.1. It used to
//! advance the rejected unary OTP floor before candidate health and
//! therefore did not provide the promised A/B rollback contract.
//! **FA-1.5 (Draft 1.1 §14 L4375, L4388–4390): the runtime floor writer
//! is REMOVED.** The legacy unary `otp::bump_to` re-programs one
//! one-program-only ECC quad-word — not retry-safe on STM32U585 — and no
//! reviewed rollback backend exists until OPEN-OTP-1..3, OPEN-ECC-1,
//! OPEN-JRN-HW-1, and OPEN-JRN-DUR-1 close. COMMIT therefore has NO
//! epoch-bump success path in any build: after the retained pre-commit
//! re-verification gates it ends in a FAIL-CLOSED REFUSAL — no OTP
//! program, no durable floor write, no reset into the staged slot BY
//! THIS HANDLER. That refusal is scoped to this handler: FSBL slot
//! selection is UNCHANGED (it re-verifies vendor fpr, signature, and
//! rollback admissibility at every boot, and the floor never moved), so
//! a staged slot whose boot-state write failed or tore can STILL be
//! selected at the next reset under the legacy try-once fall-through.
//! That is a staging-diagnosis state, not an authorization break:
//! FSBL's own re-verification is the gate, and no floor was written.
//! Production and real-vendor-key builds still compile-fail at the
//! build-script quarantine (`FW_ROLLBACK_PRODUCTION_BLOCKED` /
//! `FW_ROLLBACK_FACTORY_BLOCKED` in `secure/build.rs`).
//!
//! Runs the heavyweight checks that BEGIN could only partially do:
//!
//!   1. Drain the context (or bail if there isn't one).
//!   2. Confirm `received_*_len == expected_*_len`.
//!   3. Re-hash the written images from flash and compare against the
//!      manifest's signed hashes. Any mismatch → abort.
//!   4. Display the new measurement (8 BIP-39 words) + "Confirm
//!      update?" prompt on the NV3007 LCD. Wait for long-right.
//!   5. On confirm: write the target manifest page (`try_once = TRIED`),
//!      point the boot-state page at the new slot, re-verify from flash
//!      that the new slot is a legacy FSBL candidate, then REFUSE
//!      fail-closed (the floor write that used to follow is removed).
//!      The retained manifest/boot-state writes stage the slot for
//!      pre-production diagnosis; the handler itself performs NO
//!      activation (no floor write, no reset). FSBL slot selection is
//!      unchanged, so a torn or failed boot-state write can still leave
//!      the staged slot selected at the next reset — gated by FSBL's own
//!      manifest re-verification, never by this handler.
//!   6. On cancel: drop the context; the inactive slot stays erased.
