//! Signing rate limiter — SCA defense.
//!
//! **Threat.** Profiled DPA / template attacks against the
//! non-hardened STM32U585 HASH peripheral need many traces (typically
//! ~hundreds to ~thousands of signatures). Without a rate limit, an
//! unlocked wallet under USB / NSC control can be made to sign as
//! fast as the firmware can produce sigs (~1 s/sign with HW SHA, so
//! ~3600 sigs/hour). That gives an attacker a few hours to collect
//! enough traces for a profiled-DPA attack against the WOTS chain
//! seeds or FORS leaf secrets.
//!
//! The F-16 shuffling defense raises the per-trace cost by a factor
//! of ~10^52 (the permutation space) — but a determined adversary
//! with enough traces can still try to crack the shuffle pattern.
//! Rate limiting stretches the attack window further: from hours to
//! months.
//!
//! **Two limits enforced per signing call:**
//!
//!   - **Minimum 1-second interval** between consecutive signs.
//!     Sub-second burst signing (e.g., 100 sigs/sec via USB) is
//!     blocked: the firmware busy-waits until the interval elapses.
//!
//!   - **Per-unlock-session burst cap of 250 sigs.** After the cap,
//!     further signs are refused (`Err(())`). The user must re-unlock
//!     (PIN entry) to reset the counter. Combined with SE-side PIN
//!     attempt rate-limiting (10 attempts max before SE wipes), this
//!     bounds the long-term sign rate to ~1 sig/sec sustained.
//!
//! **State is SRAM-only** (lost on lock / idle-wipe / reset). The
//! reset-on-unlock semantic is acceptable because:
//!   - PIN unlock itself is rate-limited by the SE silicon counter.
//!   - For a determined attacker who knows the PIN, the unlock+sign
//!     cycle is bottlenecked by PIN entry (~5 s per cold unlock).
//!
//! **Future hardening** (tracked in `docs/archive/work-todo-retired-2026-07-19.md §18b`): a
//! flash-persistent daily-quota (500/day) would defeat the
//! power-cycle-bypass-burst-cap attack class. Deferred because flash
//! writes on every sign add wear; out of scope for this commit.
