///         lives or dies by whether the rest of the ERC-4337 ecosystem will
///         carry its UserOps. Bundlers (the reference bundler, Pimlico's Alto,
///         Alchemy's Rundler) run a tracer over `simulateValidation` and
///         enforce ERC-7562: during the validation phase an unstaked account
///         may only touch storage ASSOCIATED WITH ITSELF, may not use banned
///         opcodes, and may not depend on unstaked external state. Trip a rule
///         and your UserOps are dropped from the canonical mempool or the
///         account gets throttled — a failure mode that no amount of green
///         local testing reveals, because it lives in someone else's tracer.
///
///         PQSmartWallet has exactly the risk profile those rules exist for:
///         `_validateSignature` WRITES account storage during validation (it
///         bumps `bootstrapUses` for a Type-1 rotation and `slotUses[i]` for a
///         Type-2), reads the cap fields, and dispatches a heavy SPHINCS+C10
///         verification to an immutable external verifier. Before this file,
///         `grep -rn "7562\|bundler-spec-tests" docs/ contracts/` returned
///         nothing: the account's mempool-compatibility was assumed.
///
///         SCOPE, stated honestly. This is the storage/call-graph subset that
///         a Foundry test can actually decide, using `vm.record()` +
///         `vm.accesses()` and `vm.expectCall`. It does NOT replace running

///         which additionally covers banned opcodes (GAS, NUMBER, TIMESTAMP,
