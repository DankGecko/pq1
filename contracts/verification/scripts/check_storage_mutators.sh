# check_storage_mutators.sh — CLOSED-WORLD GATE for invariant I-3 ("no
# reset path", CLAUDE.md invariant #7 "per-chain caps monotonic,
# unresettable").
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# `Wallet/Invariants.lean : no_reset_path` is a kernel theorem that the
# FIVE known counter-mutators (`bumpBootstrap`, `bumpSlot`, `setOffchain`,
# `addOwner`, `removeOwner`) never decrease `bootstrapUses`, any
# `slotUses[j]`, or any `offchainSigCount[j]`. But "these are the ONLY
# Storage-mutating functions" is an *out-of-Lean closed-world assertion*:
# a future `def evilReset (s : Storage) : Storage := { s with bootstrapUses
# := 0 }` added to Storage.lean — with no matching no-decrease lemma — would
# escape the kernel entirely. `no_reset_path` would still type-check and
# still be true about its five conjuncts, yet the new resetter sits
# unverified beside it.
#
# This lint closes that gap structurally. It extracts the COMPLETE set of
# `def`s in `Wallet/Storage.lean` that *return a `Storage`* (return type
# `Storage` or `Option Storage` — the only way to introduce a new
# constructor/mutator) and the set of `def`s that perform a `{ s with ... }`
# record-update (the only way to mutate an existing `Storage`), and compares
# both against a PINNED allow-list below. If either set differs from the
# allow-list the lint FAILS — so adding any new Storage-returning /
# Storage-updating def forces a conscious decision:
#   1. add it to the allow-list here, AND
#   2. add a matching no-decrease (or counter-preservation) lemma to
#      Invariants.lean and wire it into `no_reset_path`.
#
# This converts the closed-world assumption from a comment into a CI gate.
#
# Run from anywhere; resolves the repo root from its own location.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  the Storage-returning / Storage-updating def set matches the
#      allow-list (PASS)
#   1  the set drifted from the allow-list (FAIL) — a mutator was added,
#      removed, or renamed without updating this gate
#   2  internal error (missing file / tooling)
#
# Invoked from `make verify-storage-mutators` (and from CI).

# PINNED ALLOW-LISTS
#
# (A) Every `def` in Storage.lean whose return type is `Storage` or
#     `Option Storage`. These are the only functions that can produce a
#     `Storage` value (constructor or mutator). Each entry's monotonicity /
#     counter-preservation MUST be covered by a lemma in Invariants.lean and
#     wired into `no_reset_path` (or, for the two pure constructors `empty` /
#     `initialised`, be a fresh all-zero-counter genesis state).
#
#     empty         — genesis (all counters 0; no `s` input → cannot decrease)
#     initialised   — factory genesis (all counters 0; no `s` input)
#     bumpBootstrap — no_reset_path conjunct 1 (bumpBootstrap_no_decrease)
#     bumpSlot      — no_reset_path conjunct 2 (bumpSlot_no_decrease)
#     setOffchain   — no_reset_path conjunct 3 (setOffchain_no_decrease_offchain)
#     addOwner      — no_reset_path conjunct 4 (addOwner_preserves_counters)
#     removeOwner   — no_reset_path conjunct 5 (removeOwner_preserves_counters)
#     tryInitialize — guarded wrapper over `initialised`; only fires when
#                     nextOwnerIndex == 0 (one-shot), producing the all-zero
#                     genesis state, so it cannot decrease a live counter.

#     behind a wrapper return type + a full record literal (the gap an
#     adversarial PoC demonstrated against filters (A)+(B), which key on
#     return-type and `{ s with }` syntax respectively). Allow-list = exactly the
