# Three-Claim Proof for PQSmartWallet

This document explains how `contracts/verification/` mathematically
proves three security claims about `PQSmartWallet`. Read it before
touching any of the verification artifacts — it ties together the
Lean theorems, the bytecode-level discharge artifacts (Halmos,
Certora, Foundry), and the trust assumptions.

---

## The three claims

These are the user-facing security guarantees `PQSmartWallet`
provides. Each is mathematically proven, modulo a small set of cited
trust assumptions documented in [`TRUST_ASSUMPTIONS.md`](TRUST_ASSUMPTIONS.md).

### Claim 1 — Signature-to-execution binding

> Every successful `executeWithOffchainCount` / `executeBatchWithOffchainCount`
> call corresponds to a SPHINCS+C10 signature from a current owner
> over a `userOpHash` (computed as `sphincsDigest`) that commits to
> the exact chainId, sender, nonce, and calldata being executed.

What this kills:
- Cross-chain replay (chainId is part of the digest preimage)
- Cross-account replay (sender address is part of the digest preimage)
- Nonce reuse (delegated to the deployed EntryPoint v0.6 — a cited-TCB fact
  under A2; the former `entrypoint_no_replay` axiom was DELETED 2026-06-14 as
  dangling + latent-false, nonce-replay protection is the EntryPoint's job,
  not a Lean axiom)
- Calldata substitution between the signed digest and what executes —
  the userOpHash digest cryptographically commits to `sha256(callData)`
  (kernel theorem `theft_free_with_calldata_binding`, via SHA-256
  collision-resistance). NOTE: that EntryPoint relays *exactly*
  `op.callData` to the wallet and the EVM delivers the resulting CALL is
  the cited-TCB leg (A2 EntryPoint relay-fidelity + A4 EVM delivery), NOT
  an in-kernel check. The in-kernel transient-storage credit binds only
  `ownerIndex`, and the field binding gives only digest-uniqueness —
  neither pins the signed→executed calldata relay.
- Bugs in the SPHINCS+C10 verification path or the ERC-1271
  `replaySafeHash` wrapper (verifier matches the Lean Yul model
  via A3.1)

### Claim 2 — Owner-set integrity & initialization atomicity

> The owner set is mutated only by self-call from a validated UserOp;
> never empty after `initialize`; `initialize` runs exactly once and
> cannot be front-run; the UUPS upgrade path is unreachable; no
> admin/deployer role can replace the implementation or owner set
> unilaterally.

What this kills:
- Bricking via removing the last owner
- Phantom-owner injection
- Init-front-running of counterfactual deployments
- "Trust the wallet vendor" criticism — the wallet maker cannot
  move user funds or change accounts

### Claim 3 — Execution faithfulness under batching and value flow

> `executeBatchWithOffchainCount` performs exactly the sequence of
> `(target, value, data)` tuples passed to it, in order, with no hidden
> calls, no caller other than EntryPoint-or-self reaching the executor,
> and total ETH outflow equals the sum of the batch's values.

Scope (honest): the kernel theorems pin the executed sequence to the
`executeBatch` *arguments* (order-preserving, value-sum exact). That those
arguments equal *what the owner signed* is the signed↔executed relay leg,
which rests on A2 (EntryPoint relays the signed `callData`) + A4 (EVM
delivers the CALL), cited-TCB — not an in-kernel theorem. "No callback
alters the remainder of the batch / re-enters validation" follows from the
model being a straight-line, no-loop construction (`buildBatchCalls` is a
pure function of the inputs) plus E-1 (`execute_caller_is_entrypoint` —
only EntryPoint reaches the executor); it is NOT a separately proven
reentrancy theorem (E-7 restates E-5 verbatim — same statement, same
proof).

What this kills:
- Long tail of "validation passed but something weird executed" bugs
- Malicious-target reentrancy into the account itself (via E-1's
  EntryPoint-only executor gate + the no-loop batch model; not a
  standalone reentrancy theorem — see the Claim 3 scope note)
- Batch-ordering exploits

### Claim 4 — Execution-gate non-bypass (call-graph)

> For any per-transaction step-trace through the wallet, every external
> call appearing in the post-state `callStack` was authorised by at
> least one `validate` step earlier in the same trace whose
> `c10Verifier.verify` returned `true` on the decoded
> `(pkSeed, pkRoot, sphincsDigest, innerSig)` under an installed owner
> key. There is no path — direct, re-entrant, transient-replayed, or
> via a different gateway — by which the wallet emits an external
> call without that prior verifier acceptance.

What this kills:
- "Skip-validate" attacks where a crafted EntryPoint call somehow
  reaches the executor without `validateUserOp` running first
- Transient-slot replay (re-using a single validate's
  `validatedOwnerPlusOne` for multiple executes — H-3)
- "Verifier returned false but the wallet still executed" branches
  (composes `_validateSignature`'s strict-success path with
  `_consumeValidatedOwnerIndex`'s one-shot token clear)
- Re-entry from a callback inside `executeBatch` that tries to drive
  the executor without re-validating

---

## Verification stack

Four layers compose into the proof. Each layer is independently
re-runnable; their outputs are pinned in
[`AXIOM_STATUS.json`](AXIOM_STATUS.json).

| Layer | Tool | What it proves | Files |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| **Lean 4** | `lake build` | Kernel-checked per-claim theorems against the Lean models of `validateUserOp` / `executeWithOffchainCount` / `initialize` / `addOwnerBytes` / etc. | `contracts/verification/lean/` |
| **Halmos** | `halmos --bytecode <pinned-hash>` | Symbolic execution against the pinned PQSmartWallet runtime bytecode, discharging the `DeployedBytecode.PQSmartWallet_validateUserOp = validateSignature` axiom (A3.2) | `contracts/smart-wallet/test/halmos/` |
| **Certora** | `certoraRun` | Inductive rules quantified over *all* methods, discharging A3.3 (Factory) + A3.4 (MultiOwnable) + the cross-method surface of A3.2 (Wallet) | `contracts/smart-wallet/certora/` |
| **Foundry** | `make verify-three-claims` (clean-env Forge receipt: fuzz 256; invariants 256 × 500) | Stateful fuzzing + parity tests + codehash pinning, defense-in-depth and the empirical SHA-256 KAT for A1 | `contracts/smart-wallet/test/` |

### Why all four

- **Lean alone** proves the *model* is sound but doesn't connect to
  deployed bytecode.
- **Halmos alone** verifies the bytecode but can't universally quantify
  over methods (Claim 2's "*any* method preserves the owner set" needs
  inductive reasoning).
- **Certora alone** is excellent for the universal quantification but
  uses a separate prover backend (also in the trust base).
- **Foundry alone** is empirical, not exhaustive.

The composition is the point: each tool's TCB is independent. A
soundness bug in Halmos doesn't void the Certora discharge or the
Lean theorem.

## Per-claim discharge breakdown

### Claim 1

**Lean** — `Spec/Theorems.lean::theft_free_with_calldata_binding`.
Discharges to exactly ONE axiom (corrected 2026-07-02, finding exec-lean-F2/V4 —
this block previously claimed it "composes I-1 + A3.1 + A3.2" and closed over the
deleted `sha256_injective_on_fixed_length`, BOTH false: the proof consumes only
`sphincsDigest_field_binding`, and the false injective axiom was replaced by
`sha256_collision_resistance` on 2026-06-14):
- `Wallet/SphincsDigestSpec.lean::sphincsDigest_field_binding` (equal digest ⇒
  equal preimage ∨ `BreaksHash`, via `Crypto.sha256_collision_resistance`).

This is the **digest field-binding LINK** of Claim 1, NOT the whole
signature-to-execution binding: that the EntryPoint relays `op.callData` verbatim
and the EVM delivers the CALL are the cited-TCB legs (A2 relay + A4 delivery — see
the Claim-1 description above and `ASSURANCE_CASE.md` EF-#15's 4-link chain), NOT
in-kernel. I-1 / A3.1 / A3.2 are consumed by `theft_free` / `theft_free_bytecode`,
not by this corollary.

Closure: `propext, Quot.sound, SphincsCVerify.Crypto.sha256_collision_resistance`
(verified against the live `#print axioms` dump 2026-07-02).

**Halmos** — `test/halmos/HalmosValidateUserOp.t.sol`:
- `check_validateUserOp_success_implies_verifier_accepted`
- `check_validateUserOp_rejects_wrong_selector_for_bootstrap` / `..._for_slot`
- `check_validateUserOp_rejects_nonzero_tail_pad` (audit L-1)
- `check_validateUserOp_rejects_non_entrypoint_caller`
- `check_execute_without_validate_reverts` (audit H-3)

**Certora** — `certora/PQSmartWallet.spec`:
- `validateUserOp_only_entrypoint`

**Foundry** — `test/LeanSelectorParity.t.sol` (4/4 selectors match) +
`test/PQSmartWalletInvariants.t.sol::invariant_impl_slot_unchanged`.

### Claim 2

**Lean** — `Wallet/Invariants.lean`:
- `cannot_remove_bootstrap` (I-4) — `Storage.removeOwner s 0 _ = none`
- `initialize_called_exactly_once` — `nextOwnerIndex ≠ 0 ⇒ tryInitialize = none`
- `initialize_post_state` — successful init produces `Storage.initialised`
- `owner_set_nonempty_after_init` — bootstrap present, `nextOwnerIndex = 2`
- `addOwner_preserves_index0`, `removeOwner_preserves_index0`,
  `bumpBootstrap_preserves_ownerAtIndex`, `bumpSlot_preserves_ownerAtIndex`,
  `setOffchain_preserves_ownerAtIndex` — composite invariance
- `create2_address_chain_independent` (I-7) — kernel-proves only that the
  CREATE2 salt's preimage carries no chain id (salt chain-freeness); the
  full address's chain-independence additionally rests on address-level
  EVM-TCB facts (a singleton CREATE2 factory at one address per chain +
  frozen `initCode`), made explicit in the conditional theorem
  `create2Address_chain_independent`
- `factory_requires_bootstrap_sig` (I-8)
- `eip1271_forbids_bootstrap` (I-6)
- `storage_mutations_preserve_impl_slot_disjointness` (composes
  `StorageLayout.pq_storage_disjoint_from_erc1967_impl`)

**Certora** — `certora/PQMultiOwnable.spec`:
- `bootstrap_unremovable`
- `cantInitTwice` (universally quantified over `method f`)
- `onlySelfCanChangeOwnerAtIndex`, `onlySelfCanChangeIsOwnerBytes`
- `bootstrapUses_only_increases`, `slotUses_only_increases`, `offchainSigCount_only_increases`
- `combined_cap_invariant` (inductive)
- `bootstrapUses_capped`
- `nextOwnerIndex_monotonic_growth`
- `no_owner_above_nextOwnerIndex`

**Certora** — `certora/PQSmartWalletFactory.spec`:
- `salt_depends_only_on_master_pk`
- `createAccount_must_verify_bootstrap_sig`
- `createAccount_rejects_wrong_chainId`
- `implementation_immutable`

**Foundry** — `test/PQSmartWalletInvariants.t.sol`:
- `invariant_bootstrap_owner_present`
- `invariant_nextOwnerIndex_at_least_2`
- `invariant_impl_slot_unchanged`
- `invariant_bootstrapUses_capped`
- `invariant_bootstrapUses_monotonic`

### Claim 3

**Lean** — `Wallet/Execute.lean` + `Spec/Theorems.lean::executeBatch_faithful`.
All 8 theorems:
- E-1 `execute_caller_is_entrypoint`
- E-2 `execute_rejects_self_target`
- E-3 `execute_requires_token_set` / `execute_requires_token_match`
- E-4 `execute_clears_token`
- E-5 `executeBatch_runs_in_signed_order`
- E-6 `executeBatch_value_outflow_eq_sum_values`
- E-7 `executeBatch_callback_preserves_loop` — a verbatim restatement of
  E-5 (`executeBatch_runs_in_signed_order`): identical statement and
  identical proof, so it adds the calldata-immutability *framing* but no
  independent reentrancy content
- E-8 `execute_only_validateSig_authorises`

Closure: `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound` (purely operational —
no cryptographic axioms needed).

**Halmos** — `test/halmos/HalmosExecute.t.sol`:
- `check_execute_rejects_non_entrypoint_caller`
- `check_execute_rejects_self_target` (audit H-2)
- `check_execute_requires_validated_owner_index` (audit H-3)
- `check_execute_rejects_owner_index_mismatch`
- `check_execute_clears_token_no_replay`
- `check_executeBatch_rejects_any_self_target`
- `check_executeBatch_k2_order_preserving` (k=2 bounded; k>2 covered
  inductively by Lean theorem E-5)

**Certora** — `certora/PQSmartWalletExecute.spec`:
- `execute_does_not_touch_owner_table`
- `executeBatch_does_not_touch_owner_table`
- `onlyEntryPoint_reaches_executor` / `..._batch_executor`
- `executeBatch_rejects_self_at_position_0`

**Foundry** — `test/PQSmartWalletInvariants.t.sol`:
- `invariant_combined_cap_slot0` / `invariant_combined_cap_slot1`
- `invariant_bootstrapUses_monotonic`

### Claim 4

**Lean** — `Wallet/TxFlow.lean` + `Spec/Theorems.lean::every_call_gated_by_verifier`.
Composes:
- `Wallet/TxFlow.lean::applyStep_token_set_only_by_validate_success` —
  the transient `validatedOwnerPlusOne` is unforgeable: every
  `0 → non-zero` transition is a slot-path `validate` step whose
  `validateSignatureOk` predicate holds at the pre-state (so
  `verify_fn` returned `true`).
- `Wallet/TxFlow.lean::validate_step_preserves_callstack` — `validate`
  cannot, by definition, append a call.
- `Wallet/Execute.lean::execute_only_validateSig_authorises` (E-8) —
  every successful `execute` / `executeBatch` step requires
  `validatedOwnerPlusOne = ownerIndex + 1` on entry.
- `Wallet/Invariants.lean::validateSignature_only_via_verify` (I-1) —
  bridges `validateSignatureOk` to the explicit `verify_fn = true`
  witness used inside `StepVerified`.
- Trace-level induction over `runTrace` assembles the above into the
  headline statement.

Closure: `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound` (kernel-only — no
new axioms; reuses I-1 and E-8; confirmed by
`scripts/dump_axioms_claim4.lean`). IMPORTANT scope: this trace gate
constrains the `verify_fn` field *supplied* in each trace's `validate`
step — it is a model-level statement and is NOT lifted here to the
deployed `SPHINCsC10Asm.verify` bytecode. Its closure carries no bridge
axiom, so there is no in-kernel "A1 + A3.1 + A4 lift" of this gate to the
on-chain verifier. The deployed-verifier connection is made separately,
and only for value-moving paths, by `theft_free` (via A2 + A3.1): a
wallet-balance decrement implies the *deployed* verifier accepted an
installed-owner C10 sig over the op digest. Pinning the pure call-graph
gate — value=0 external calls — to the on-chain verifier remains an OPEN
obligation (`OPEN_PROOF_OBLIGATIONS.md`).

The conclusion is existential: it yields *some* abstract pre-state
`σ_pre` and a `StepVerified` step in the trace. `σ_pre` is existentially
quantified — not pinned to be the reachable on-chain wallet state — and
the result is not per-call attribution (that strengthening is in
`OPEN_PROOF_OBLIGATIONS.md`). The existential is already sufficient to
rule out the bypass attack: a trace containing zero verifier-true
validates cannot produce any external call.

**Halmos** — `test/halmos/HalmosExecute.t.sol::check_execute_requires_validated_owner_index`
and `check_execute_clears_token_no_replay` discharge the
per-transaction shape against the pinned bytecode (one execute per
validate; no transient replay).

**Certora** — `certora/PQSmartWalletExecute.spec::onlyEntryPoint_reaches_executor`
+ `onlyEntryPoint_reaches_batch_executor` cover the universal
quantification over methods that could reach `target.call`.

**Foundry** — `test/PQSmartWallet.t.sol::test_bootstrapCannotCallExecute`
+ `test_rotationBootstrap...` exercise the transient gating
concretely (try-execute-without-validate reverts; validate-then-execute
succeeds).

## Trust assumptions (cited TCB)

The proof rests on six lettered assumptions, documented in detail in
[`TRUST_ASSUMPTIONS.md`](TRUST_ASSUMPTIONS.md):

| Axiom | What it asserts | Discharge |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| **A1** | EVM precompile `0x02` implements FIPS 180-4 SHA-256 | Cited universal Ethereum TCB + NIST CAVS KAT test |
| **A2** | EntryPoint v0.6 is unhackable (validate ⇒ execute dispatch, no direct debit, nonce uniqueness) | Cited: OZ / ChainSecurity / Spearbit audits + 18+ months mainnet operation. Per user decision, kept as cited-TCB. |
| **A3.1** | Deployed `SPHINCsC10Asm.verify` = Lean Yul model | Halmos against pinned codehash `0x94a6…50e9` + Lean ↔ Rust ↔ Solidity differential |
| **A3.2** | Deployed `PQSmartWallet.validateUserOp` = Lean `validateSignature` | Halmos against pinned codehash `0x4201…006f` |
| **A3.3** | Deployed `PQSmartWalletFactory.createAccount` = Lean precondition | Certora against pinned codehash `0xe40c…2270` |
| **A3.4** | Deployed `PQMultiOwnable.ownerAtIndex` = Lean storage model | Certora + storage-slot parity test |
| **A4** | EVM bytecode executes per spec (Cancun) | Cited universal Ethereum TCB (KEVM as referent) |
| **A5** | SPHINCS+C10 is EUF-CMA secure | Cited: Barbosa et al. ASIACRYPT 2024 + Hülsing PQC2022 |
| **A5-injective** | SHA-256 collision-free on equal-length inputs (corollary of A5) | Cited corollary |
| **A6** | Lean 4 kernel checks proofs correctly | Lean 4 kernel built-ins |

Out of scope (not in TCB, deliberately excluded): firmware, side
channels, gas/DoS, MEV/bundler manipulation, adversarial frontends.

## How to run the verification

### Locally

```bash
cd contracts/verification
make verify-three-claims
```

This runs:
1. `lake build` — Lean kernel type-checks every theorem (zero sorries).
2. `make verify-audit` — prints axiom dependency closure for each
   per-claim corollary.
3. `bash scripts/lint_axioms.sh` — fails on any new `True`-typed
   axiom outside the allowlist.
4. A clean-environment `forge build && forge test --json` — runs the
   Foundry unit / parity / codehash tests and rejects failures, empty result
   sets, filters, any drift from the pinned label/status/kind manifest,
   reduced fuzz counts, missing or failed corpus-replay fields, or any skip
   outside the two pinned RPC-dependent receipt tests.
5. A clean-environment `forge test --json --match-contract Invariants` —
   every invariant record must report exactly 256 runs × 500 calls
   (128,000 calls), explicit zero reverts, and an explicit zero
   corpus-replay-failure count.
6. `halmos --contract HalmosValidateUserOp` and `halmos --contract HalmosExecute`
   — symbolic execution against pinned bytecode (skips if `halmos`
   not installed).
7. `certoraRun` on each of the 4 conf files (skips if
   `CERTORAKEY` unset).
8. Per-claim summary.

### In CI

**`make verify-three-claims` is a LOCAL/manual end-to-end convenience bundle — it
is NOT a single CI job** (correction 2026-07-02: an earlier
`contracts/.github/workflows/verify-three-claims.yml` was a *nested* `.github`
path that GitHub Actions never executes — repo-level workflows only run from the
root `.github/workflows/` — so "runs the same pipeline on every PR" was never
true, and the bundle's Halmos/Certora legs need a patched toolchain / a
`CERTORAKEY` secret unavailable in CI). What IS CI-enforced, per-PR, are the
bundle's *constituent* gates, each in a root workflow:
`verify-build`/`verify-audit`/`verify-fv-lints`/`verify-ledger-consistency`/
`verify-storage-mutators` (`.github/workflows/lean-fv.yml`), `verify-transcription`
(`a31-transcription.yml`), and the Foundry `forge test` + codehash-freeze
(`ci.yml`). The Halmos/Kontrol symbolic discharge (steps 6–8) is a local/manual
gate (see `verify-bytecode` in `scripts/gate_enforcement.json`, `enforcement:
local_documented`). Run the whole bundle locally with `make verify-three-claims`
(fixed 2026-07-02: it deterministically exited 141 mid-run — a `head`-under-
`pipefail` SIGPIPE).

The ledger gate's authoritative local/CI invocation is the clean pre-exec
receipt boundary below (run from the repository root):

```bash
(
  builtin exec -c /usr/bin/bash --noprofile --norc -p \
    contracts/verification/scripts/run_authoritative_make.sh \
    make -C contracts/verification verify-ledger-consistency
)
```

The outer `builtin exec -c` is part of the security boundary: it clears the
environment before a new dynamic loader starts. The launcher accepts only the
exact ledger target and requires its exact completion marker in a private
receipt. A bare `make -C contracts/verification verify-ledger-consistency` is
useful diagnostically, but is not an authoritative hostile-environment receipt:
loader controls can otherwise suppress Make before its in-file guards run.

### Just the Lean kernel check (fastest, no Foundry/Halmos/Certora)

```bash
cd contracts/verification
make verify-build       # ~10 s incremental
make verify-audit       # prints axiom closures
```

### Just the Foundry tests

```bash
cd contracts/smart-wallet
forge test --match-contract "LeanSelectorParityTest|StorageSlotParityTest|PinnedCodehashesTest|PQSmartWalletInvariantsTest"
```

---

## When the bytecode changes

Any source change that drifts the runtime codehash invalidates the
pin in `test/PinnedCodehashes.t.sol`. The CI gate fails until:

1. Re-capture the new codehash via `forge test --match-test test_codehash_pinned_or_print -vv`.
2. Update `test/PinnedCodehashes.t.sol` + `docs/PINNED_CODEHASHES.md`.
3. Re-run the affected discharge artifact:
   - `PQSmartWallet` change → `halmos --contract HalmosValidateUserOp` + `halmos --contract HalmosExecute`
   - `PQSmartWalletFactory` change → `certoraRun certora/confs/PQSmartWalletFactory.conf`
   - `PQMultiOwnable` change → `certoraRun certora/confs/PQMultiOwnable.conf`
   - `SPHINCsC10Asm` change → `cross_validation/` Lean ↔ Rust ↔ Solidity differential
4. Update `AXIOM_STATUS.json` with the new discharge artifact ID
   (session hash / rule-set hash).

axiom closure. The Foundry layer has exercised every pinned invariant
at the documented campaign bounds. The Halmos and Certora layers, when
their tools are available, discharge the bytecode-level axioms against
the pinned runtime codehashes.

This is what "mathematically proven" looks like in practice — every
artifact is independently re-runnable, every trust assumption is
named and pinned, and the dependency closure of each per-claim
corollary is auditable in one `#print axioms` output.

## Marketing / public claims — what you can and cannot say

This section exists to keep public statements about the proof
defensible. The work is real and substantial; overclaiming would
undermine its credibility and expose us to consumer-protection risk
if a wallet is later drained.

### The current honest state

| Layer | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Lean 4 kernel-checked theorems | ✅ **Verified.** `lake build` exits 0, zero sorries, axiom closures match what's documented. |
| Foundry parity + invariant tests | ✅ **Verified by the local/manual gate.** The clean-environment receipt contains 120 results: 118 successes, the exact 2 pinned RPC-dependent skips, 2 fuzz tests × 256 runs, and 6 invariants × 256 runs × 500 calls. CI separately runs the default Foundry suite; it does not produce this count-bound receipt. |
| Halmos symbolic execution against pinned bytecode | ⚠️ **Spec committed, tool not yet run in CI.** The rules are written and `halmos.toml` pins versions, but no one has executed `halmos --bytecode <pin>` against the runtime codehash. The A3.1 / A3.2 bridge axioms are therefore *defined* but *not mechanically discharged*. |
| Certora inductive rules | ⚠️ **Spec committed, license not provisioned.** Same situation for A3.3 / A3.4. |
| A2 (EntryPoint v0.6) | 📚 **Cited-TCB.** Per project decision, kept as cited (OZ / ChainSecurity / Spearbit audits + 18 mo mainnet operation). Not in-Lean discharged. |
| A4 (EVM bytecode executes per spec) | 📚 **Cited-TCB.** Universal Ethereum trust statement; KEVM as referent. |
| A5 (SPHINCS+C10 EUF-CMA) | 📚 **Cited-TCB.** Barbosa et al. ASIACRYPT 2024 proved EUF-CMA for SPHINCS+; the SPHINCS+C transition is by published reduction (Hülsing PQC2022) but not re-mechanized in EasyCrypt. |

### ✅ Safe to say

These are exactly accurate descriptions of what is true today:

- "Formal verification of three core security properties in Lean 4,
  kernel-checked with zero `sorry`."
- "Three security claims are mathematically proven against models of
  the wallet's signature validation, owner management, and execution
  paths, modulo a documented set of cited trust assumptions
  (Ethereum EVM, SHA-256 precompile, SPHINCS+C10 EUF-CMA, EntryPoint
  v0.6, Lean 4 kernel)."
- "Every axiom in the dependency closure is named and pinned; the
  closure is machine-checkable via `#print axioms`."
- "Discharge artifacts (Halmos and Certora rule sets, Foundry
  invariants) are committed and re-runnable; each bytecode-level
  axiom is bound to a pinned runtime codehash."
- "The wallet vendor cannot move user funds or change accounts — this
  is a theorem (`Wallet.Invariants.cannot_remove_bootstrap` +
  `addOwner_preserves_index0` + the Certora `onlySelfCanChange*`
  rules), not a promise."
- "The local/manual verification gate records 118 successful Foundry
  results, the exact two pinned RPC-dependent skips, two fuzz tests at
  256 runs each, and six stateful invariants at 128,000 calls each."

### ⚠️ Defensible only with qualifiers

- "**Mathematically proven**" — only when paired with *what* is
  proven (the three claims, named) and *under what* (cited axioms).
  Never standalone, never as "mathematically proven secure" in the
  general sense.
- "**Bytecode-verified**" — only after Halmos and Certora have
  actually been run in CI. Until then, the bytecode bridge is
  axiomatic, not discharged.

### ❌ Do not say

- "Unhackable."
- "No bugs are possible."
- "Provably secure" (without naming what's proven).
- "The Lean kernel verified the smart contracts." (It verified the
  Lean *models* of them, with a documented bridge axiom to the
  deployed bytecode.)
- "Quantum-secure forever." (SPHINCS+C10 is conjectured PQ-secure
  under SHA-256 standard assumptions; "forever" is unscientific.)
- Anything that implies the proof covers domains it doesn't:
  gas / DoS / MEV / bundler ordering / frontend integrity / key
  extraction / side channels / firmware bugs.

### Before launching the campaign

To maximally tighten the claims, in order of difficulty:

1. **Run Halmos in CI** (FOSS; `pip install halmos`). Upgrades A3.1
   and A3.2 from "spec-defined" to "discharged against pinned
   bytecode." Couple-hour exercise.
2. **Run Certora in CI** (needs `CERTORAKEY` secret). Upgrades A3.3
   and A3.4. Couple-day exercise once licensed.
3. **Third-party audit of the Lean modeling decisions** — not the
   proofs themselves (the kernel checks those), but whether the Lean
   `ExecState` / `Storage` / `sphincsDigest` definitions faithfully
   capture the Solidity semantics. Most rigorous addition.
4. **Pin a public discharge artifact ID** in `AXIOM_STATUS.json` after
   each tool run, so external auditors can independently re-verify by
   re-running the exact pinned session.

Until step 1 lands, the most accurate framing of the Halmos/Certora
layers is "spec-defined and ready to re-run" rather than "currently
discharged." The Lean kernel work and the Foundry suite are
unconditionally honest as stated.

### Legal posture

This proof reduces — but does not eliminate — wallet-loss tail risk.
The remaining risk lives in: (a) implementation bugs outside the
spec (gas, DoS, frontend, firmware), (b) cryptographic-assumption
failure (SHA-256, SPHINCS+C10 EUF-CMA), (c) the cited-TCB axioms
(EntryPoint v0.6, EVM semantics), and (d) the modeling assumptions
(does our Lean `ExecState` perfectly mirror the EVM call stack?
mostly yes, but not formally proven). Public statements should not
imply zero residual risk.
