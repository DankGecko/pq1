**Global credit-conservation aggregate** for the EIP-1153 per-index
validated-op credit discipline — the credits-native successor's *completeness*
complement to the per-index exactly-once anti-replay already proven in
`Spec.Theorems` (`every_call_consumes_its_own_validated_credit`).

## What this file adds (work-todo FV-#5)

The per-index lemmas prove the STRONGER fact (a single stamp at index `i`
funds at most one execute at `i`). This file proves the GLOBAL aggregate the
old single-`validatedOwnerPlusOne` token ledger used to give before the GAP-11
per-index refactor (commit 84ae543) stranded it:

  **In any successful transaction trace started from a clean transient
  (`∀ i, σ0.credits i = 0`, the EIP-1153 boundary at tx entry), the number of
  money-moving `execute`/`executeBatch` steps is ≤ the number of `validate`
  steps.**

The tight content is the *credit-reserve conservation*
(`exec_count_le_validate_count_aux` / `creditConservation`):

  `countExec tr ≤ countValidate tr + sumOver σ.credits S`

i.e. executes can outrun validates only by drawing on credits already banked
in the carrier `S`. At the tx boundary (`S = []`, all credits zero) the reserve
is zero, so `countExec ≤ countValidate` (`exec_count_le_validate_count`).

## Honest scope (do NOT oversell)

  * The headline counts **ALL** `validate` steps (including failed validates,
    bootstrap `ownerIndex = 0` validates, and `removeOwnerAtIndex` validates —
    none of which stamp a credit). It is therefore *looser* than
    `#executes ≤ #stamping-validates`; a static `countP` cannot express
    "stamping" because that is state-dependent (it needs the decode + cap +
    verifier outcome at that step). The per-index exactly-once result remains
    the OPERATIVE anti-replay; this is the global completeness complement.
  * This is the **credits-native** aggregate, derived directly from the
    `Execute` require/consume lemmas via a genuine (mathlib-free) finite-support
    sum (`sumOver` over a running duplicate-free carrier). It is NOT a revival
    of the deleted single-token `validatedOwnerPlusOne` ledger (which was
    unfaithful to the per-index bytecode model) — do not "restore" that.

The reusable deliverable is the `sumOver` / `carrierNodup` machinery: a small
mathlib-free finite-support-sum kit (`docs/.../how_to_math_proof_secureness.md`
flagged this as "machinery this project omits").

`#print axioms` for `exec_count_le_validate_count` and `creditConservation` =
`{ propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound }` (kernel-only — same closure as the
existential `every_call_gated_by_verifier`). Gated in `dump_axioms.lean`.

/-! ## Mathlib-free finite-support sum over a running duplicate-free carrier

`credits : Nat → Nat` has unbounded domain, so "total live credits" is a sum
over its (finite) support. With no mathlib we build the minimum kit: a sum over
an explicit carrier list `S` that we maintain duplicate-free and which contains
exactly the indices touched so far. Only four facts are needed: a congruence,
the off-carrier no-op, and the +1 / −1 deltas for a stamp / consume at an index
already in the (nodup) carrier. -/
