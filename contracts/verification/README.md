# PQSmartWallet — Formal Verification

> **Status (2026-06-10).** The Lean 4 kernel checks the headline theorem

This directory contains the **mechanised formal-verification stack** in
progress toward one goal:

> **Theft-freedom (target).** No adversary — without knowledge of the
> firmware-resident SPHINCS+C10 secret keys — can cause value held by a
> deployed `PQSmartWallet` proxy to be transferred to an address they
> control.

The proof is structured against the contracts under
`contracts/smart-wallet/src/` (`PQSmartWallet.sol`, `PQMultiOwnable.sol`,
`PQSmartWalletFactory.sol`, `verifiers/SPHINCsC10Asm.sol`).

## Trusted assumptions

| # | Assumption |
|---|---|
| A1 | SHA-256 EVM precompile at `0x02` implements FIPS 180-4. |
| A2 | EntryPoint v0.6 is unhackable (only invokes execution after `validateUserOp` returned success; does not move wallet balance directly). |
| A3 | `solc 0.8.28` compiles the wallet + verifier sources to faithful EVM bytecode. |
| A4 | EVM bytecode executes per the EVM specification. |
| A5 | SPHINCS+C10 is EUF-CMA secure (composed from SHA-256 SM-DT-TCR + ITSR + ROM on `H_msg`). |
| A6 | Lean 4 kernel checks proofs correctly. |

Out of scope: firmware (Rust under `secure/`, `nonsecure/`, …), side-channel
resistance, gas/DoS, MEV. See [`docs/TRUST_ASSUMPTIONS.md`](docs/TRUST_ASSUMPTIONS.md).

## Status (2026-06-10)

The `theft_free` theorem is kernel-checked by Lean 4. The dependency
closure is exactly the documented 11-axiom set (see below); the
substantive content of each axiom varies — see
[`docs/AXIOM_STATUS.json`](docs/AXIOM_STATUS.json) for the per-axiom report.

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| `lake build` end-to-end | ✅ Succeeds on Lean 4.22.0 |
| `theft_free` theorem | ✅ Kernel-checked; closure = exactly the 11 cited axioms. |
| Wallet invariants I-1 through I-8 | ✅ All closed; details in [`docs/AXIOMS.md`](docs/AXIOMS.md). |
| Bridge axioms A1 / A3.1 | ✅ `opaque + axiom-equality` shapes with real content. A3.1 spec-refinement (`verifyRefined_eq_spec`) is `rfl`, incl. the FORS `htIdx` ADRS binding; verifier **input gates** also discharged on bytecode by Halmos (3 rules) + a ≈250-mutant adversarial screen. |
| Bridge axioms A3.2 / A3.2-exec / A3.3 / A3.4 (bytecode) | ✅ **Discharged on the deployed bytecode** by Halmos symbolic execution, both profiles: validate pointwise + per-property (`HalmosValidateUserOpEquiv`/`HalmosValidateUserOp`), execute pointwise over a **symbolic ∀ ownerIndex** + per-property (`HalmosExecuteEquiv`/`HalmosExecute`), factory iff (`HalmosFactory`), owner-table pointwise + read-parity (`HalmosMultiOwnable`, replaces stale Certora) — all vs the pinned codehashes (`make verify-bytecode`). |
| Bridge axiom A4 (`evm_bytecode_executes_correctly`) | 📚 CITED-TCB `True` marker (KEVM as formal-EVM referent), per user decision. |
| EntryPoint axiom (A2) | 📚 CITED-TCB. Property of the Lean `handleOp` model of EntryPoint v0.6; cited OZ/ChainSecurity/Spearbit audits + 18mo mainnet. |
| Cryptographic axiom (A5) `EUF_CMA_SPHINCSplusC` | 📚 CITED-TCB. Real propositional content; cites Barbosa et al. ASIACRYPT 2024 + Hülsing PQC 2022. |
| Cryptographic shape axioms (A5 components) | 📚 CITED-TCB `True` markers (Barbosa et al. modular reduction). |
| Source-level `sorry`s | ✅ 0 sorrys (audited via `scripts/check_no_sorry.lean`). |
| `True := trivial` theorem placeholders | ✅ 0 (all four upgraded 2026-06-10; allowlist empty). |
| Contract faithfulness | ✅ Lean model tracks the in-use contracts: FORS `htIdx` binding (fcee705a) + validation-phase bootstrap-cap bump (PQBootstrapCapEvasion fix). |
| Solidity test suite | ✅ `forge test` 99/99 incl. PinnedCodehashes + PQBootstrapCapEvasion + 10 KAT vectors. |

cd lean
elan toolchain install $(cat lean-toolchain)

```

`dump_axioms.lean` shows every closed headline theorem's axiom dependencies.
The headline `theft_free` theorem depends on exactly:
`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` (Lean kernel);
`precompile_0x02_is_FIPS_180_4` (A1); `entrypoint_honest` (A2);
`solidityVerifier_compiles_correctly` (A3.1);
`evm_bytecode_executes_correctly` (A4);
`EUF_CMA_SPHINCSplusC`, `SM_DT_TCR_F`, `ITSR_F`, `hMsg_random_oracle` (A5).

## Roadmap

There is **one phase**. It collapses every previously-numbered phase and the
wallet-invariants work. See [`docs/OPEN_PROOF_OBLIGATIONS.md`](docs/OPEN_PROOF_OBLIGATIONS.md)
for the full work-item list, grouped by source-file area (Verifier / Wallet /
Bridge / Crypto / Top-level).

**Total**: ~6–9 person-months focused work for one engineer.

## What this proves TODAY (honest version)

The Lean kernel checks the propositional statement
`SphincsCVerify.Spec.Theorems.theft_free` (see
`lean/SphincsCVerify/Spec/Theorems.lean`) with the bridge axioms in
their **post-refactor `opaque + axiom-equality` form**: A1
(`precompile_0x02_is_FIPS_180_4`) and the four A3 sub-axioms
(`solidityVerifier / solidityWallet / solidityFactory /
solidityMultiOwnable _compiles_correctly`) carry real propositional
content — each equates an *opaque deployed-bytecode symbol* to its
kernel-reducible Lean model, and removing any one leaves the per-claim
corollaries unprovable. Only A4 (`evm_bytecode_executes_correctly`) and
the three A5 crypto-shape axioms remain `True`-typed cited-TCB markers.

So `theft_free` is a kernel-checked guarantee about the wallet's logic
*relative to* the bridge axioms; the bridge axioms are then
**discharged on the deployed bytecode** by the Halmos sessions under
[`../smart-wallet/test/halmos/`](../smart-wallet/test/halmos/) — run on
**both** compiler profiles against the pinned codehashes. What is
discharged on bytecode, and the honest residual of each, is enumerated
in [`docs/AXIOM_STATUS.json`](docs/AXIOM_STATUS.json):

- **A3.2 validate / A3.2-exec execute / A3.3 factory / A3.4 owner-table**
  — `discharged-bytecode` (pointwise equivalence to the Lean models;
  the execute money-path over a **symbolic ∀ ownerIndex**).
- **A3.1 verifier** — `discharged-bytecode-partial`: input gates on
  bytecode + an executable Lean↔FIPS↔bytecode differential covering the
  **digest, htIdx, AND the full functional verify** (each 10/10, all
  HARD CHECKS since 2026-06-12 — `Spec.Signature.verify` reproduces the
  deployed bytecode's accept/reject decision on the entire KAT corpus) +
  the bytecode-side 10-vector KAT + a ≈250-mutant adversarial screen.
  The remaining residual is the **∀-signature symbolic equivalence**
  (corpus-validated, not proven — GAP-2; intractable under uninterpreted
  SHA-256, needs Kontrol/KEVM or Verity). See the postmortem in
  [`docs/A3_1_VERIFIER_GAP.md`](docs/A3_1_VERIFIER_GAP.md). This residual
  is the reason an unqualified "verifier proven to bytecode" claim is
  still not supportable.
- **A1 SHA-256** — uninterpreted in every Halmos run (the named boundary).
- **A2 EntryPoint / A4 EVM / A5 EUF-CMA** — cited-TCB by decision. The
  emitted-CALL byte-delivery on the execute path lives in A4.

The headline guarantee, modulo A1–A6:

> For any deployed `PQSmartWallet` proxy at address `W`, for any EVM state
> transition `σ → σ'` triggered by a UserOp accepted by EntryPoint v0.6, if
> `balance(σ', W) < balance(σ, W)`, then the UserOp's `signature` field
> carries a SPHINCS+C10 signature, valid under an installed owner key of
> `W`, over the canonical `userOpHash`.

Equivalently: an adversary who does not hold an installed SPHINCS+C10 secret
key cannot reduce the wallet's balance, modulo A1–A6.

> **⚠️ Read `modulo A1–A6` literally.** This is a guarantee *relative to*
> the trusted axioms — it is only as strong as their discharge. As of
> 2026-06-11 the **A3.1** axiom (deployed verifier = Lean `verifyYulModel`)
> is **contradicted by a concrete KAT vector** (the Lean spec returns
> `false` where the bytecode returns `true`), so on the *verifier*
> dimension this guarantee does **not** yet transfer to the deployed

**Honest ceiling (unchanged).** A Halmos rule is a cited Halmos+z3 solver
session — the harness↔property match and the
LeanModel.sol↔Lean-file transcription are in the TCB — not a Lean kernel
proof term. The `EUF_CMA_SPHINCSplusC` discharge is the citation to
Barbosa et al. ASIACRYPT 2024 plus the SPHINCS+ → SPHINCS+C transition
argument.
