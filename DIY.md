# Build Your Own PQ1

*Snapshot 2026-07-21.*

Every hardware wallet claims to be open source. Here's our test: **can you build the
product yourself, from the vendor's own repo, and end up with the real thing?**

For the PQ1 the answer is yes. The **entire wallet — post-quantum signer, dual secure
elements, trusted display, PIN gating — runs on four boards you can order today**: no
custom PCB, no NDA'd datasheet, no factory, no secret provisioning step you have to take
our word for. This is not a stripped-down demo or a "community edition" — it is the exact
bench rig the shipping firmware is developed and silicon-validated on, built from the
same repo we build factory images from. Roughly **$150 in parts** and an afternoon of jumper wires
gets you a working post-quantum ERC-4337 hardware wallet that signs real SPHINCS+C10
transactions on its own screen.

That's the point of this page. Not "trust us, it's audited" — *build it, boot it, read
every line it runs.*

Don't want to buy anything? The whole wallet also boots in QEMU:

```bash
make play        # interactive wallet in QEMU — arrow keys, PIN entry, seed wizard, signing
```

## Bill of materials

| # | Part | What it is in the PQ1 | Buy | ≈ Price |
|---|------|------------------------|-----|---------|
| 1 | **ST B-U585I-IOT02A** Discovery kit | The wallet itself — STM32U585 (Cortex-M33, TrustZone), hardware SHA-256/SAES/TRNG. The on-board ST-LINK/V3E is your programmer, so no extra probe needed. | [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/STMicroelectronics/B-U585I-IOT02A) | $70 |
| 2 | **Infineon OPTIGA™ Trust M Shield** (`TRUSTMV3SHIELDTOBO1`) | Secure element #1 (Trust M V3, CC EAL6+). Holds one XOR half of your seed entropy; talks encrypted I²C (Shielded Connection). | [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Infineon-Technologies/TRUSTMV3SHIELDTOBO1) | $15 |
| 3 | **NXP OM-SE050ARD-E** dev kit | Secure element #2 (EdgeLock SE050E, CC EAL6+). Holds the other entropy half + silicon PIN counter; talks SCP03. Get the `-E` variant — it's the SE050 you can actually buy on a dev board, and the firmware's anti-substitution check currently pins its fingerprint. ⚠ Needs the two-minute SCP03 keyset swap described under "Flash it" before the build will talk to it. | [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/NXP-Semiconductors/OM-SE050ARD-E) | $40 |
| 4 | **NV3007 1.65″ IPS display module**, 142×428, 8-pin SPI header (`GND·VCC·SCK·MOS·RES·DC·CS·BLK`) | The trusted display — PIN entry, seed words, and every transaction render here, inside the secure world. Get the breakout-board version, not the bare FPC panel. | [AliExpress — the exact breakout we use](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008894658602.html) · reference module: [EastRising ER-TFTM1.65-2](https://www.buydisplay.com/1-65-inch-142x428-ips-tft-lcd-display-module-for-arduino-raspberry-pi) | $10 |
| 5 | Solderless breadboard, 400-point (1×) | Holds the OPTIGA shield, the two buttons, and the 3V3/GND rails. | [Mouser (BB400T)](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/BusBoard-Prototype-Systems/BB400T) | $7 |
| 6 | Jumper wires — one 40-pack **M–F** + one 40-pack **M–M** (~20 actually used) | Everything below is point-to-point 2.54 mm jumpers. | [Mouser (Adafruit 826, M–F)](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Adafruit/826) · [Mouser (Adafruit 758, M–M)](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Adafruit/758) | $9 |
| 7 | 2× 6 mm tactile push buttons | The entire user input: LEFT / RIGHT. Physical confirm only — no touchscreen, no input controller IC. | [Mouser (Omron B3F-1000)](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Omron-Electronics/B3F-1000) | $1 |
| 8 | Micro-USB **data** cable + USB-C cable | Micro-USB → the ST-LINK debug port for flashing; USB-C → powers the finished device and carries the companion-app HID link. You probably own both. | — | — |

**Total ≈ $150**, most of it the Discovery kit. Prices drift — trust the links, not this column.

Soldering: possibly none. The Discovery kit and the SE050 kit arrive assembled; if the
OPTIGA shield or the display breakout ship with loose pin headers, those two headers are
the only iron work in the build.

## How it goes together

```
   [ NV3007 LCD ]        [LEFT] [RIGHT]        ← trusted display + confirm buttons
        │ SPI (4 wires)       │ GPIO (2)          (both live on the breadboard)
   ┌────┴─────────────────────┴─────┐
   │   OM-SE050ARD-E   (SE #2)      │  ← stacks directly on the Arduino headers
   ├────────────────────────────────┤
   │   B-U585I-IOT02A  (STM32U585)  │  ← the wallet
   └───────────────┬────────────────┘
                   │ I²C1 (D14/D15) + reset
        [ OPTIGA Trust M V3 shield ]   ← SE #1, seated in the breadboard
```

About **20 jumpers** total. The SE050 shield passes the Arduino headers through, so most
signal taps land on its top header (J2: `1=D8 · 2=D9 · 3=D10 · 4=D11 · 6=D13 · 7=GND ·
9=SDA/D14 · 10=SCL/D15`). First, feed the breadboard rails: one jumper from a 3V3 socket
to the **+** rail, one from GND to the **–** rail.

**OPTIGA shield — 6 wires:**

| OPTIGA pin | Goes to |
|---|---|
| `3V3` | breadboard **+** rail |
| `GND` | breadboard **–** rail |
| `CTL` | breadboard **+** rail (power gate, always on) |
| `SCL` | `D15` (SE050 J2:10) |
| `SDA` | `D14` (SE050 J2:9) |
| `RST` | **`D6`** on the Discovery board's own CN14 socket — ⚠ read below |

> ⚠ **The one trap in this build:** put the OPTIGA reset wire on the CN14 position
> **silkscreened D6 — not D5.** The stacked SE050 shield routes D5 to the SE050's ENA
> line, so an OPTIGA reset pulse on D5 power-cycles the SE050 mid-write (we bricked a
> provisioning run learning this). And yes, on this board the CN14 silkscreen is
> off-by-one versus the user manual — the firmware drives PE0, which is the pad labeled
> D6. Full story: `docs/archive/work-todo-retired-2026-07-19.md` Completion Log 2026-04-23.

**NV3007 display — 8 wires:**

| Module pin | Goes to |
|---|---|
| `GND` | breadboard **–** rail |
| `VCC` | breadboard **+** rail — power VCC **before** any logic pin |
| `SCK` | `D13` (SE050 J2:6) |
| `MOS` | `D11` (SE050 J2:4) |
| `CS`  | `D10` (SE050 J2:3) |
| `DC`  | `D4` on the Discovery's own CN14 socket (the SE050 shield doesn't break out D0–D7) |
| `RES` | breadboard **+** rail — **tie to 3V3, do NOT wire to a GPIO**; the firmware resets the panel in software |
| `BLK` | breadboard **+** rail (backlight always on) |

**Buttons — 4 wires:** LEFT button between `D8` (SE050 J2:1) and the **–** rail; RIGHT
between `D9` (J2:2) and the **–** rail. Active-low, internal pull-ups — no resistors.

## Flash it

One-time setup (details in `docs/hardware/dev-board-setup.md`):

```bash
rustup target add thumbv8m.main-none-eabi
cargo install probe-rs-tools
# + STM32CubeProgrammer from st.com (writes the TrustZone option bytes; free account)
```

> ⚠ **One code tweak first — SE050 SCP03 keyset (as of 2026-07-20).** The production
> part was finalized as the SE050**C2** (`SE050C2HQ1/Z01SDZ`), and the factory SCP03
> platform keys in `secure/src/scp03_logic.rs` were retargeted to it (commit
> `66a9926f`). The dev kit above carries an SE050**E2**, which ships with a
> *different* published keyset (OEF `A921`) — so an unmodified build fails SCP03 with
> a card-cryptogram mismatch and the wallet never provisions. Fix: restore the three
> `PLATFORM_{ENC,MAC,DEK}` constants to the E2 values before building —
> `git show 66a9926f^:secure/src/scp03_logic.rs` prints them (they're the published
> AN12436 factory keys, also in NXP's plug-and-trust `ex_sss_tp_scp03_keys.h`). Keep
> it as a local edit; don't commit it. Both keysets are public — on a bench build the
> SCP03 channel is structural, not confidential, either way (see the caveat at the
> bottom).

Then, with the Micro-USB cable on the ST-LINK port:

```bash
make flash-hw-dual-se-lcd-standalone
```

That one target builds both TrustZone worlds (dual-SE + LCD + buttons + USB), flashes
them, programs the TrustZone option bytes, and resets. Move the JP4 jumper to `5V_UCPD`,
unplug the programmer, plug in USB-C — the device now boots standalone: measured-boot
fingerprint, then the first-boot wizard walks you through PIN and a 24-word seed **on the
device's own screen**, provisions both secure elements with XOR entropy halves, and
you're signing. First signature ≤ 3 s; ~1.1 s warm. (To re-run the wizard on a used rig:
`make wipe-for-wizard`.)

## What you just built

- **A real post-quantum signer.** Every signature is SPHINCS+C10 — hash-based, no ECDSA
  anywhere — verified on-chain by the same Yul verifier the production wallet uses.
- **A real dual-SE seed split.** Your seed entropy is XOR-split across the OPTIGA and the
  SE050. Neither chip alone — desoldered, decapped, whatever — holds a single bit of it.
- **A real trusted display.** Transactions are decoded and rendered inside the TrustZone
  secure world; the companion app never gets to substitute a hash.
- **PIN gating in silicon, three ways per attempt.** An ordinary wrong attempt
  charges the SE050 UserID, OPTIGA E120, and MCU flash counter. Boot can only
  compare MCU page 124 with readable E120, directionally; SE050 still enforces
  its independent max-10 lockout but its attempt attribute is not peek-readable.
- **Verifiability.** The build is reproducible (`docs/firmware/reproducible-builds.md`,
  `make verify-repro`), and the boot fingerprint — 8 BIP-39 words on the LCD — lets you
  check the flash contents against a build you made yourself. This is the same property
  production units ship with (at RDP-0, flash verifiable over SWD before first power).

**The honest caveat:** a breadboard PQ1 is a real signer, not a hardened one. The dev
build pairs the secure elements with bench keys, leaves the OPTIGA in its unlocked
lifecycle state, keeps the debug port open, and its jumper wires are gloriously easy to
probe. Production units burn all of that down at provisioning (`docs/archive/production-todo-retired-2026-07-19.md`).
The cryptography is identical; the armor is not. Don't put your savings behind a
breadboard — do use it to verify that everything we claim about the firmware is true, on
hardware you own.

That's the trade the PQ1 offers: the breadboard proves there's nothing hidden; the
production unit is the same design with the armor on — locked lifecycle states, sealed
per-device provisioning, closed debug port, one enclosure instead of twenty jumpers.
You can hold the open version in one hand and the hardened one in the other and know
both were built from this repo — same signer, same drivers, same trusted-display code,
with the production hardening features you can read right here switched on.
